The Voyager 1 spacecraft had flown past this moon of Jupiter, catching the first glimpse of active volcanism on a world other than Earth. Umbrella-shaped outbursts of magmatic matter rocketed into space from all over Io’s surface. “They looked amazingly beautiful,” said Bolton, who is now based at the Southwest Research Institute in Texas. “It was like an artist drew it.

According to Nimmo, “there’s a fundamental difference between a liquid-water ocean and a magma ocean. The magma wants to escape; the water really doesn’t.” Liquid rock is less dense than solid rock, so it wants to rise and erupt quickly; the new study suggests that it doesn’t linger at depth long enough inside Io to form a massive, interconnected ocean. But liquid water is, unusually, denser than its solid icy form. “Liquid water is heavy, so it collects into an ocean,” Sori said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“I think that’s the big-picture message from this paper,” Sori added. Tidal heating might struggle to create magma oceans. But on icy moons, it can easily make watery oceans due to the bizarrely low density of ice. And that suggests life has a multitude of potentially habitable environments throughout the solar system to call home.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 class='text-xl font-semibold'\u003eHell’s Poster Child\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe revelation that Io is missing its shallow magma ocean underscores just how little is known about tidal heating. “We’ve never really understood where in Io’s interior the mantle is melting, how that mantle melt is getting to the surface,” de Kleer said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOur own moon shows evidence of primeval tidal heating too.

The moon was significantly closer to Earth back then, and the gravitational fields from the Earth and the sun were battling for control. At a certain threshold, when the gravitational influence of both were roughly equal, the moon might have temporarily adopted an elliptical orbit and gotten tidally heated by Earth’s gravitational kneading. Its interior might have remelted, causing a surprise secondary flourish of volcanism.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut exactly where within the moon’s interior its tidal heating was concentrated—and thus, where all that melting was happening—isn’t clear.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePerhaps if Io can be understood, so too can our moon—as well as several of the other satellites in our solar system with hidden tidal engines.

The hackers also defaced the homepage of Tupolev’s website to show an owl clutching a Russian aircraft. “There is nothing secret left in Tupolev\u0026#39;s activities for Ukrainian intelligence,” HUR said in a statement. “The result of the operation will be noticeable both on the ground and in the sky.” The move follows Ukraine’s unprecedented drone operation earlier this month that damaged or destroyed 41 Russian aircraft, including bombers and spy planes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 class='text-xl font-semibold'\u003e\u003ca href='https://www.interpol.int/News-and-Events/News/2025/20-000-malicious-IPs-and-domains-taken-down-in-INTERPOL-infostealer-crackdown' class='link'\u003eInternational Law Enforcement Conducts Major Takedown of Infostealer Infrastructure\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn Wednesday, a consortium of cops from Interpol and 26 countries announced a takedown, dubbed “Operation Secure,” of domains and other digital infrastructure linked to 69 infostealer malware variants.

If a classical search algorithm just spooled through all the listings to find you, it would require 50 million operations, on average.

Qubits have to be carefully shielded, and operated at very cold temperatures—sometimes only fractions of a degree above absolute zero. A major area of research involves developing algorithms for a quantum computer to correct its own errors, caused by glitching qubits. So far, it has been difficult to implement these algorithms because they require so much of the quantum processor’s power that little or nothing is left to crunch problems. Some researchers, most notably at Microsoft, hope to sidestep this challenge by developing a type of qubit out of clusters of electrons known as  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/two-physicists-bet-over-a-quantum-computing-moonshot/' class='link'\u003ea topological qubit\u003c/a\u003e .

It’s not clear how long this awkward phase will last, and like human puberty it can sometimes feel like it will go on forever. Researchers in the field broadly describe today’s technology as Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum computers, putting the field in the NISQ era (if you want to be popular at parties, know that it’s pronounced “nisk”). Existing quantum computers are too small and unreliable to execute the field’s dream algorithms, such as Shor’s algorithm for factoring numbers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe question remains whether researchers can wrangle their gawky teenage NISQ machines into doing something useful. Teams in both the public and private sector are betting so, as Google, IBM, Intel, and Microsoft have all expanded their teams working on the technology, with a growing swarm of startups such as Xanadu and QuEra in hot pursuit. The US, China, and the European Union each have new programs measured in the billions of dollars to stimulate quantum R\u0026amp;D. Some startups, such as Rigetti and IonQ, have even begun trading publicly on the stock market by  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/quantum-startups-stock-market-dreams-are-decohering/' class='link'\u003emerging with a\u003c/a\u003e  so-called special-purpose acquisition company, or SPAC—a trick to quickly gain access to cash.

In any case, Stanford’s president, John Hennessy, liked the Jobs option best and made the request.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eBy this point Jobs had declined many such invitations. But he’d turned 50 and was feeling optimistic about recovering from cancer. Stanford was close to his house, so no travel was required. Also, as he told his biographer Walter Isaacson, he figured he’d get an honorary degree out of the experience.

In his own keynotes and product launches, Jobs was confident. He pushed his team with criticism that could be instant and corrosive, even cruel. But this was decidedly not an Apple production, and Jobs was at sea as to how to pull off the feat. Oh, and Stanford  \u003ca href='https://bulletin.stanford.edu/academic-polices/graduation/degree-conferral' class='link'\u003edoesn’t give out honorary degrees\u003c/a\u003e . Whoops.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn January 15, 2005, Jobs wrote an email to himself (Subject: Commencement) with initial thoughts. “This is the closest thing I’ve ever come to graduating from college,” Reed College’s most famous dropout wrote. “I should be learning from you.” Jobs—famous, of course, for his ultra-artisanal organic diet—considered dispensing nutritional advice, with the not terribly original slogan “You are what you eat.” He also mused about donating a scholarship to cover the tuition of an “offbeat student.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eFlailing a bit, he reached out for help from Aaron Sorkin, a master of dialog and an Apple fan, and Sorkin agreed. “That was in February, and I heard nothing,” Jobs told Isaacson. “I finally get him on the phone and he keeps saying ‘Yeah,’ but … he never sent me anything.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne day at Pixar, Jobs ran into Tom Porter. As Spencer Porter says it, Jobs asked Tom if his son could send over a few pointers. The students sent Jobs some thoughts. Hennessy told him to forget abstract advice and make the speech personal.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eEventually, Jobs recruited his old friend Michael Hawley to help him out. Hawley was a polymath associated with the MIT Media Lab. A brilliant technologist, he was once a cowinner of a worldwide piano competition for “outstanding amateurs,” and he later organized a TED-like conference called EG. Hawley had worked with Jobs at Next and even shared a house with him at the time. They had kept in close touch.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHawley’s contribution to the speech has been somewhat of an open secret for years. Still, there is no mention of him in  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eBecoming Steve Jobs\u003c/em\u003e , by Brent Schlender and Rick Tetzeli, which devoted a chapter to the speech. The Isaacson biography doesn\u0026#39;t cite him and neither does, surprisingly, the exhibit at the Steve Jobs Archive. In an online  \u003ca href='https://www.media.mit.edu/videos/mike-hawley-fest-2020-04-21/' class='link'\u003eFestschrift\u003c/a\u003e  for Hawley in April 2020, Jobs’ son Reed spoke about Hawley’s role, including the “don’t puke” email quoted above. But Hawley never spoke publicly about exactly how he helped Jobs—except for one day in 2020, while driving around Boston with the journalist John Markoff a few months before Hawley’s death at age 58 from cancer. Markoff recorded the conversation, none of which has been made public until now.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs Hawley recounted to Markoff, Jobs first tried to get him to deliver the address. “He told me he was hoodwinked, as he put it, into giving a speech at Stanford and just didn’t know what to say or do,” Hawley said. “He wanted to turn it down, he wanted to get me to do it instead. I said, ‘No way—it’s your gift.’ He then basically begged me, in a very sweet way, a very Steve way, to help him out. And I said sure.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHawley loved Jobs’ idea of opening with his own experience of not graduating from college. Jobs had been kicking around the idea of giving the students “three pieces of advice as you leave college.” The first would be about “surrounding yourself with people smarter than you.” He didn’t seem to have a second. The third was built around the fact that “we are all going to die. You are going to die.” A few days later, Jobs drafted some lines about the  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/whole-earth-catalog-now-online-internet-archive/' class='link'\u003eWhole Earth Catalog\u003c/a\u003e , figuring some notes on its final issue might work as a potential ending to his speech.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“He had the closing idea before he had any of the content of the speech,” Hawley said. He urged Jobs to strengthen the kicker. “Like a good comedian telling a joke, or a good composer writing a piece of music, you want to be sure to nail the punch line, so I think maybe think more about the ending,” he wrote to Jobs in an email. “I like your Whole Earth recollection a lot. I grew up with it too. Even the phrase WHOLE EARTH taps a powerful idealistic undercurrent.” He suggested a few tweaks and reminded Jobs that he’d have to explain what the catalog was. As Hawley told Markoff, “I said, ‘Look, this was Google for our generation … And I said for god’s sake, give credit to  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/backward-looking-futurism-stewart-brand/' class='link'\u003eStewart Brand\u003c/a\u003e , whose poetic touch infused all that and so much more.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe archive exhibit contains eight emails that Jobs sent himself. There’s a gap between early May and June; presumably, Jobs was preparing for a more familiar sort of presentation at that time: his opening keynote at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference on June 6. Onstage in San Francisco that day, Jobs was masterful, stalking the stage in alpha fashion, explaining a new phenomenon called podcasting (“We see it as the hottest thing going in radio”) and the Macintosh’s switch from PowerPC to Intel processors. But the Stanford deadline was looming. By June 7, he was back to sending emails to himself. Hawley told him that, just like an undergraduate, he might have to pull an all-nighter to finish the speech.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBy all accounts, Jobs did have a marathon writing session, working with Laurene. Hawley had suggested that he print out the speech, squint at it, and practice reading it out loud. “You don\u0026#39;t want to be stumbling with your nose in a page, so just walk down the street and read it to a tree a few times so that you\u0026#39;re comfortable with the page turns or whatever,” Hawley told him. For the next few days, Jobs rehearsed and revised and, as Schlender and Tetzili wrote in their book, read it to his whole family at dinner.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe night before the ceremony, Stanford held a dinner for various commencement guests. Jobs’ attendance was uncertain. “The entire day we were hearing Steve is coming,” Porter says. “Then we heard Steve is not coming, definitely not. Then, 30 minutes before, we hear he is coming.” When Jobs arrived, he gravitated to his Pixar employee Tom Porter, who introduced him to his son and the other copresidents. They thanked him effusively for doing the speech. “I should never have agreed to do this,” he told them. “I don’t have any jokes. It’s not going to go well.” He told them that just days before, he had considered backing out. The copresidents looked at each other in horror. “We were like, holy shit, this guy doesn’t even want to be here,” says Paola Fontein, one of the copresidents. “Should we have gotten Jon Stewart?” Another copresident, Steve Myrick, thought to himself,  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eI sure hope he shows up tomorrow.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJobs woke up on the morning of the 12th riddled with anxiety. “I’d almost never seen him more nervous,” Laurene Powell Jobs would tell Schlender and Tetzeli. Even on the short drive from his home to the stadium—their three kids in the back—he rode shotgun in the family SUV, still tweaking the speech. When they tried to get to the VIP parking lot, they couldn’t find the pass that would gain them entry. They had trouble convincing the guard that the frazzled guy in a black T-shirt and ripped jeans was actually the commencement speaker, but they finally got through. (Jobs had earlier asked Hennessy if it would be OK to wear jeans, and indeed he showed up in Levi’s and Birkenstocks.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe family went to a luxury suite while Jobs was fitted with regalia. By the time Jobs joined the procession to the podium with President Hennessy and other guests, the atmosphere in the stadium had taken on a rowdy aspect. Commencement day at Stanford has a carnival element. The graduates-to-be circled the field in a “wacky walk” and wore preposterous costumes over their robes. A lot of them were still fuzzy from celebrating the night before. Also, it was a sizzling summer day. So after Hennessy gave Jobs a warm introduction, the speaker faced a boisterous audience distracted by the heat. And Jobs was about to give a speech that could have qualified as the downer of all time—setting graduates off into their new lives by reminding them that they were going to die.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eThough he almost certainly practiced the 15-minute speech enough to memorize it—in his keynotes he would speak articulately without notes for an hour—he opted here to read from his printed sheets of paper.

That worked out well for him.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFrom the video, it seemed the audience was listening politely. Some hardly did. Even Porter, the copresident who most wanted Jobs there, was somewhat distracted. “It was so unbelievably hot that a lot of time during that speech I just spent drinking water and looking for more water,” he says. The Stanford band had been instructed to play a note each time Jobs said a word on the Bingo card, so there were some bleats when he hit the squares for words like “dropout” or “Next.” Graduation speeches often are crafted to evoke laughter, but the closest Jobs got to a joke was when he mentioned how Windows copied the Mac—a drive-by remark on how the Macintosh\u0026#39;s treatment of fonts set the tone for the entire computer industry. Jobs didn’t acknowledge the crowd’s response. He kept reading.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Most folks had gone out celebrating the night before, so you had a group of tired people sitting in the sun,” Myrick says. “But you could tell it was something that he had really put thought into. I remember thinking, ‘Wow, like, I\u0026#39;d like to go back and read that when I\u0026#39;m not in this situation.’” Hennessy says that he knew from the start that Jobs was delivering a thoughtful, moving oratory, never mind the printed sheets.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eJobs concluded with the words printed on the back cover of the final issue of the Whole Earth Catalog: “Stay hungry, stay foolish.” It was exactly the uplifting kicker that Hawley had asked for.

At his keynotes, Jobs was used to a more thunderous response when announcing, say, a new OS feature or how many iPods sold in the past year. After a few seconds, though, some students stood, seemingly more out of respect than jubilation. Most others followed suit. It isn’t clear that the speaker noticed. He simply looked relieved. “Steve wasn\u0026#39;t so sure it went well as we headed out of the stadium,” Hennessy says. “But I assured him it had.” Jobs returned home with his family, glad the episode was over.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt was only the beginning.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt that point in time, YouTube was only months old, Twitter didn’t exist, and Facebook didn’t even have its news feed. The national media hadn’t covered the speech. Apple sent out no press releases. But Stanford published the transcript on its primitive website, and people began discovering it. I recently checked my inbox for June 2005 and found multiple copies sent to me from different mailing lists. As the weeks and months went by, more and more people found the speech. Berlin describes it as going “slow-motion viral.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“The speech started to get talked about, how honest it was,” says Porter, the class copresident. “I would have meetings in Hollywood—I’m a TV writer—and people would see I was from Stanford and ask if I saw that speech that Steve Jobs gave.” Jobs himself seldom mentioned it; at least I never saw him quoted on the subject. He joked to one person that he’d bought it from CommencementSpeeches-dotcom. He responded to a thank-you note from the copresidents by saying, “It was really hard for me to prepare for this, but I loved it (especially when it was over).”\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eSix years later, something happened that would change the way viewers perceived the speech. On the podium Jobs had said that his cancer diagnosis and his surgery a year later had been the closest he had come to facing death, and that he hoped to have a few more decades. On October 5, 2011, after many months of fighting the cancer he told students he had beaten, Steve Jobs died.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnyone replaying his speech today knows how much he accomplished in his 56 years. As much as any public figure in our time, Jobs lived according to the advice he offered the students that day. He pursued what he loved and refused to lead anyone else’s life, and the result can be measured in his legendary products. But as life-changing as his gadgets were, none strike the heart and soul as intimately as the Stanford speech. Random example: In 2016, after the Cleveland Cavaliers lost the first two games of the NBA finals, LeBron James  \u003ca href='https://www.espn.com/nba/playoffs/2016/story/_/id/16390925/nba-playoffs-2016-how-lebron-james-cleveland-cavaliers-lifted-curse' class='link'\u003eplayed the speech\u003c/a\u003e  for the disheartened squad in the locker room.

The reason for that will be the construction and completion of the first commercial fusion demonstrators. These cutting-edge facilities are smaller than fusion power plants. For instance, a laser-based fusion demonstrator might use five to ten laser beams, while a commercial power plant can use several hundred. However, they have a crucial role—to prove that fusion technology works on a small scale, paving the way for the construction of larger fusion-power plants. In 2024, they will do just this, starting to build devices that will finally achieve the elusive goal of energy gain– in other words, outputting more energy than the quantity needed to kickstart the fusion process. Hitting this milestone is a critical step in addressing the steeply increasing global energy demand, as fusion energy has the potential to provide an abundant, carbon-free source of power.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003caside class='Sidebar-pgAgH kmwJca'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eREAD MORE\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis story is from the  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/wired-world' class='link'\u003eWIRED World in 2024\u003c/a\u003e , our annual trends briefing.

This experiment used high-power lasers to deposit energy in a small fuel target—a millimeter-sized capsule containing frozen deuterium and tritium—creating the conditions for fusion to occur. The lasers delivered 2.05 megajoules of energy to the target, resulting in a fusion energy production of 3.1 megajoules. This was a scientific experiment—unlike fusion demonstrators, the NIF is not designed to operate continuously like a power plant. However, as a result of this scientific breakthrough, nuclear fusion has attracted considerable research, political, and investor attention in recent months.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNational fusion strategies have been developed in the US, UK, Japan, Germany, and other countries to advance research and testing of the technology. Currently, the US and the UK are leading the race: The US Department of Energy funds fusion research with an annual budget of about  \u003ca href='https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/news-updates/2023/03/13/fy24-budget-fact-sheet-rd-innovation/' class='link'\u003e$1.4 billion\u003c/a\u003e  and encourages private enterprises to accelerate commercialization. The UK similarly fosters public-private partnership by raising a fusion cluster with universities and companies combining their expertise. High-profile investors recognize the opportunity of fusion technology, with over $5 billion of private capital flowing into fusion companies in the last two years.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe initiatives are bearing fruit: Several fusion companies worldwide, including Commonwealth Fusion Systems, Helion Energy, and General Fusion have announced plans to begin constructing facilities in 2024 to demonstrate their technological approach. According to the latest report by the  \u003ca href='https://www.fusionindustryassociation.org/learn-about-fusion-energy/' class='link'\u003eFusion Industry Association\u003c/a\u003e , over half of all fusion companies believe that fusion energy will be delivered to the public power grid during the 2030s. In May 2023, Microsoft signed a power purchase agreement with Helion Energy, to secure a supply of fusion-generated electricity by 2028. In August 2023, Marvel Fusion (a fusion energy firm I cofounded) announced a partnership with Colorado State University worth $150 million, the largest public-private partnership to date, with the aim of building the only laser facility tailored to a commercial laser-based fusion technology and the most powerful short-pulse laser system in the world. With these advances and commitments in place, 2024 is set to show that fusion is no longer a distant dream but an achievable future of clean and sustainable energy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","publishedAt":"2024-06-19T14:00:00Z","categories":["Ideas","WIRED World"],"keywords":["climate change, Infrastructure, Cities, transportation, Electric Vehicles","science, Energy, physics, Power"]},{"title":"Wood Pellet Mills Are Prone to Catching Fire.

But before Elimini and GSNR can build their mills, they are hoping to secure a viable plan for transporting the wood pellets.

Blacklock told Grist the organization based its wildfire project on  \u003ca href='https://www.fs.usda.gov/rm/pubs_journals/2024/rmrs_2024_davis_k001.pdf' class='link'\u003eresearch\u003c/a\u003e  known as the Tamm Review, which found that thinning combined with prescribed burns can reduce wildfire severity by 62 to 72 percent.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut climate scientist Dominick DellaSala said the authors of the Tamm Review mis-cited their own work and ignored 37 papers contradicting their findings. “The forest is no longer a forest,” DellaSala added. “The fire-thinning question has been very narrowly scoped to get a preconceived outcome … None of them look at the collateral damages to ecosystems and the climate—only if fuels are reduced enough to lower intensity.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eKim Davis, research ecologist with the USDA Forest Service and lead author of the 2014 Tamm Review study, said she stands by the findings that mechanical treatments can reduce future fire severity when combined with prescribed fires, adding that the 37 studies DellaSala cited were not included because they did not meet sufficiently strict scientific standards. “This research underwent rigorous statistical, technical, and peer review,” said Davis. “We respectfully disagree with the statement that our work improperly cited or misrepresented studies and data.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn any case, the US Forest Service already cuts down dense areas of forest it believes are particularly at risk from wildfires and burns them in controlled areas, known as slash piles.

When these trees are removed in logging operations, like opening the air vent on a wood stove, the increased ventilation can cause a fire to spread quickly. “If a fire occurs it can spread rapidly through the forest due to higher wind speeds and drying out of the understory by tree canopy removals,” said DellaSala. “Hence the forest is over-ventilated and more prone to fast-moving, wind-spread fires.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe pellet mills, which have a history of setting on fire and producing piles of combustible dust, have to be built in clearings within forests so that woody fuel can be delivered.

Unfortunately, you can’t keep your information perfectly safe: It is often impossible to avoid sharing data, especially with organizations like governments and health insurers. Furthermore, in cases where a company or institution gives your information to an additional party, you’ve often agreed to share more data than you realize by clicking \u0026#34;I accept\u0026#34; on a dense user agreement.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eMany of these incidents don’t necessarily even involve hackers.

As a result, the repercussions of a breach can be very delayed, sometimes not fully manifesting for years.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAttackers tend to capitalize on certain types of data right away, namely financial information like credit card numbers. But other troves of data disappear into the criminal ecosystem and become a sort of ticking time bomb as personal details are combined and recombined with other stolen information.

Unfortunately for victims, there is no such thing as perfect security, and no way to eliminate all data breaches. But massive institutional breaches don’t need to happen as often as they do. Many occur not because of complex and sophisticated hacking but because organizations have made basic and potentially avoidable mistakes in implementing their security schemes.

A few stand out, though, as instructive examples of how breaches have evolved, how attackers are able to orchestrate these attacks, what can be stolen, and what happens to data once a breach has occurred.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDigital data breaches started long before widespread use of the internet, yet they were similar in many respects to the leaks we see today. One early landmark incident occurred in 1984, when the credit reporting agency TRW Information Systems (now Experian) realized that one of its database files had been breached. The trove was protected by a numeric passcode that someone lifted from an administrative note at a Sears store and posted on an “electronic bulletin board”—a sort of rudimentary Google Doc that people could access and alter using their landline phone connection. From there, anyone who knew how to view the bulletin board could have used the password to access the data stored in the TRW file: personal data and credit histories of 90 million Americans. The password was exposed for a month. At the time, TRW said that it changed the database password as soon as it found out about the situation. Though the incident is dwarfed by last year’s breach of the credit reporting agency Equifax (discussed below), the TRW lapse was a warning to data firms everywhere—one that many clearly didn’t heed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eLarge-scale breaches like the TRW incident occurred sporadically as years went by and the internet matured. By the early 2010s, as mobile devices and the Internet of Things greatly expanded interconnectivity, the problem of data breaches became especially urgent. Stealing username/password pairs or credit card numbers—even breaching a trove of data aggregated from already public sources—could give attackers the keys to someone’s entire online life. And certain breaches in particular helped fuel a growing dark web economy of stolen user data.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003caside class='Sidebar-pgAgH kmwJca'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eWhat Counts as a Data Breach?\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eA data breach occurs any time an entity accesses information it wasn’t meant to. If someone inconspicuously looks over your shoulder at your smartphone and reads what you’re typing, that’s a data breach. If someone a block away uses binoculars to look through your window and see what you’re watching on TV, that’s a data breach as well. You may not think it matters if someone knows you like  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eThe Good Place\u003c/em\u003e , but if it isn’t your intent for people to see what you’re watching, it’s a violation of your expectations.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of these incidents was a breach of LinkedIn in 2012 that  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/2012/06/linkedin-data-breach/' class='link'\u003einitially seemed\u003c/a\u003e  to expose 6.5 million passwords. The data was hashed, or cryptographically scrambled, as a protection to make it unintelligible and therefore difficult to reuse, but hackers quickly started “cracking” the hashes to expose LinkedIn users’ actual passwords. Though LinkedIn itself took precautions to reset impacted account passwords, attackers still got plenty of mileage out of them by finding other accounts around the web where users had reused the same password.

To a degree, it is possible to review access logs and other system indicators to determine this, but generally organizations have no way of knowing for certain what went on while they weren’t watching. This is what makes data exposures such a big problem, whether it’s through your window or via a database that a company left accessible online: It’s always possible that someone realized they could peek in and exfiltrated some information without anyone realizing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eData breaches didn’t truly become dinner table fodder, though, until the end of 2013 and 2014, when major retailers Target, Neiman Marcus, and Home Depot suffered massive breaches one after the other.

And while tech companies, not to mention regulators, are starting to take data protection  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/biden-2023-sotu-data-privacy/' class='link'\u003emore seriously\u003c/a\u003e , the industry has yet to turn the corner. In fact, some of the most disheartening breaches yet have been disclosed in recent years.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYahoo lodged repeated contenders for the distinction of all-time biggest data breach when it made an extraordinary series of announcements beginning in September 2016. First, the company disclosed that an  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/2016/09/hack-brief-yahoo-looks-set-confirm-big-old-data-breach/' class='link'\u003eintrusion in 2014\u003c/a\u003e  compromised personal information from 500 million user accounts. Then, two months later, Yahoo added that it had suffered a separate breach in  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/2016/12/yahoo-hack-billion-users/' class='link'\u003eAugust 2013\u003c/a\u003e  that exposed a billion accounts. Sounds like a pretty unassailable lead in the race to the data-breach bottom, right? And yet! In October 2017, the company said that after further investigation it was  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/yahoo-breach-three-billion-accounts/' class='link'\u003erevising its estimate of 1 billion accounts\u003c/a\u003e  to 3 billion—or every Yahoo account that existed in August 2013.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIncredibly, Yahoo isn\u0026#39;t the only tech giant that\u0026#39;s dealt with an absurd string of data breaches. In January, for example, the mobile telecom giant T-Mobile said that it had  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/tmobile-data-breach-again/#:~:text=In%20July%202022%2C%20T-Mobile,digital%20security%20and%20data%20defenses.' class='link'\u003esuffered a\u003c/a\u003e   \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/tmobile-data-breach-again/' class='link'\u003edata\u003c/a\u003e   \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/tmobile-data-breach-again/#:~:text=In%20July%202022%2C%20T-Mobile,digital%20security%20and%20data%20defenses.' class='link'\u003ebreach beginning in November 2022\u003c/a\u003e  that impacted 37 million current customers—exposing information like names, email addresses, phone numbers, billing addresses, dates of birth, account numbers, and service plan details. The breach was sizable but might not have been so noteworthy if T-Mobile hadn\u0026#39;t developed a reputation over the past  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/2015/10/hack-brief-hackers-steal-15m-t-mobile-customers-data-experian/' class='link'\u003edecade\u003c/a\u003e  for data breaches.

For example, the credit monitoring firm Equifax is notorious for disclosing a  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-protect-yourself-from-that-massive-equifax-breach/' class='link'\u003emassive breach\u003c/a\u003e  in September 2017 that exposed personal information for 147.9 million people, most of whom were living in the United States. The data included birth dates, addresses, some driver’s license numbers, about 209,000 credit card numbers, and Social Security numbers—meaning that almost half the US population potentially had their  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/the-equifax-breach-exposes-americas-identity-crisis/' class='link'\u003ecrucial secret identifier exposed\u003c/a\u003e . Because the information stolen from Equifax was so sensitive, it\u0026#39;s widely considered the worst corporate data breach ever. At least for now. Equifax also  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/equifax-breach-response/' class='link'\u003ecompletely mishandled its public disclosure and response\u003c/a\u003e  in the aftermath.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere have since been  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/equifax-breach-no-excuse/' class='link'\u003enumerous indications\u003c/a\u003e  that Equifax had a dangerously lax security culture and lack of response procedures in place. Former Equifax CEO Richard Smith  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/equifax-ceo-congress-testimony/' class='link'\u003etold Congress in October 2017\u003c/a\u003e  that he usually only met with security and IT representatives once a quarter to review the company\u0026#39;s security posture. And hackers got into Equifax\u0026#39;s systems for the breach through a known web framework vulnerability for which a patch had been available for months. A digital platform used by Equifax employees in Argentina was even protected by the ultra-guessable credentials \u0026#34;admin, admin\u0026#34;—a truly rookie mistake.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn India, the government  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/2011/08/ff_indiaid/' class='link'\u003eidentification database Aadhaar\u003c/a\u003e  stores personal information, biometrics, and a 12-digit identification number for more than 1 billion Indian citizens, and it is incorporated by both the government and private companies into a range of foundational digital services. These interconnections, though, have led to  \u003ca href='https://jsis.washington.edu/news/the-aadhaar-card-cybersecurity-issues-with-indias-biometric-experiment/' class='link'\u003enumerous major breaches\u003c/a\u003e  of  \u003ca href='https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/13/aadhaar-leak-pm-kisan/' class='link'\u003eAadhaar data\u003c/a\u003e  from both third parties and the Indian government itself.

On the other hand, the  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/lapsusdollar-uber-rockstar-breach-multifactor-authentication-weaknesses/' class='link'\u003efrequency of successful attacks\u003c/a\u003e  doesn’t seem to have abated. And data aggregators like Equifax, that pull in an enormous amount of public and private information from myriad sources, have become a single point of failure of the digital age. More and more often, attackers target data analytics companies or digital services that are  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/twilio-breach-phishing-supply-chain-attacks/' class='link'\u003eincorporated into other products and networks\u003c/a\u003e  as a one-stop-shop for valuable information.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn short, the security breach train rolls on. The global hotel chain Marriott’s is another example of a repeat target. The company notably suffered a  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/marriott-hack-protect-yourself/' class='link'\u003emassive breach in 2014\u003c/a\u003e  that compromised data on nearly 340 million customers globally, including hundreds of millions of passport numbers. The company didn\u0026#39;t discover the incident until 2018, though. Ultimately, Marriott was forced to pay fines over the incident, including one for about $24 million from the United Kingdom\u0026#39;s Information Commissioner’s Office. As if that wasn\u0026#39;t enough, though, the hotelier had a  \u003ca href='https://www.reuters.com/article/us-marriott-intnl-data-breach/marriott-says-5-2-million-guests-exposed-in-new-data-breach-idUSKBN21I3DC' class='link'\u003ebreach in January 2020\u003c/a\u003e  that impacted data of more than 5 million customers and another one in June 2022 in which hackers claimed to have  \u003ca href='https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/06/marriott-breach-again/' class='link'\u003estolen 20 gigabytes of Marriott data\u003c/a\u003e , including customer credit card details.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class='AssetEmbedWrapper-eVDQiB byBkf asset-embed'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cpicture class='ResponsiveImagePicture-cWuUZO dUOtEa AssetEmbedResponsiveAsset-cXBNxi lqMXz asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image'\u003e\u003cimg src='https://media.wired.com/photos/5a726e8cd107c842c752925b/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/whatsnext.jpg' alt='Data Breaches The Complete WIRED Guide'\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eThe Future of Data Breaches\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eAttackers are able to perpetrate most current data breaches relatively easily by exploiting an institution’s basic security oversights. If businesses and other institutions learned from these organizations’ mistakes, there could be a real reduction in the number of data breaches that occur overall. But improvement doesn’t come from making breaches impossible. The best mitigations come from accepting the possibility of a breach and significantly raising the barrier to entry or the resources required to carry one off. This way unskilled hackers or those who are just idly poking around won\u0026#39;t be able to find as many blatant vulnerabilities to easily exploit.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAn important concept in security, though, is the idea of the cat and mouse game. For determined, motivated, and well-resourced attackers, improved defenses spur malicious innovation. This is why security is an endless expense that institutions often try to minimize, cap, or avoid altogether—defenders need to think of everything, while attackers only need to find one small mistake. An unpatched web server or an employee falling for a phishing scam can be all it takes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat’s also why some of the most groundbreaking examples of next-generation hacking come from targeted attacks to surveil high-profile individuals and groups—often political candidates, dissidents, activists, or spies attempting to infiltrate each others’ organizations. Hackers working to carry out these types of high-priority attacks will develop or pay large sums of money for so-called  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/2014/11/what-is-a-zero-day/' class='link'\u003ezero-day exploits\u003c/a\u003e  to weaponize against their targets. These consist of two parts: information about an undisclosed vulnerability in a system, and software that is programmed to take advantage of that flaw to give some type of increased system access or control to whoever deploys the exploit. A software developer can’t defend a vulnerability they don’t know about, so zero-day exploits push the limits of what’s possible for attackers by giving them a secret path into a network or database.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003caside class='Sidebar-pgAgH kmwJca'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eWhat Should Institutions Do?\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eLock It Down\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eRequire users to set up strong, unique passwords and two-factor authentication to access network services.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eKeep ’Em Out\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eImplement access controls so everyone can’t access everything.

But for now, enough easy targets remain that criminal attackers often  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/lapsus-hacking-group-extortion-nvidia-samsung/' class='link'\u003edon’t need to work very hard\u003c/a\u003e  or spend a lot of money to perpetrate massive data breaches. Even just using publicly available internet scanning tools can reveal unprotected devices and databases where valuable information is tantalizingly exposed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs one protection for their citizens, government should offer purpose-built universal identity schemes that incorporate numerous, diverse authenticators.

But organizations always vacillate between factoring in cost, ease of use, and risk. There’s no simple way to reconcile the three. And even if there were, no security scheme is ever perfect. The best way to minimize the impact of a mega-breach, then, is not just to reduce the number of incidents, but to better manage the inevitable fallout.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class='AssetEmbedWrapper-eVDQiB byBkf asset-embed'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cpicture class='ResponsiveImagePicture-cWuUZO dUOtEa AssetEmbedResponsiveAsset-cXBNxi lqMXz asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image'\u003e\u003cimg src='https://media.wired.com/photos/5a728b04d8520d1deb145f56/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/learnmore.jpg' alt='Data Breaches The Complete WIRED Guide'\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eLearn More\u003c/div\u003e\u003cul class='list-disc pl-5 space-y-2'\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/2016/10/inside-cyberattack-shocked-us-government/?GuidesLearnMore' class='link'\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eInside the Cyberattack That Shocked the US Government\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003eWIRED’s dramatic account of the massive Office of Personnel Management hack.

He wants to go get pizza, and there’s a spot nearby he’s never been to. “The reviews look great,” he assures me. We walk out the door, and he leads the way: left at the grocery store, right at the corner, another right at the wine bar. A woman waiting at a crosswalk looks at Minor, then at his white cane, and stares for a moment, before shouting past me, over the noise of the traffic, in a tone she probably intends to sound encouraging: “You sure are brave to cross this intersection like that.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e“What other choice do I have?” Minor replies, and smiles.

One night in 2006, as he and his older brother slept in their bedroom, his father, angry after being threatened with a divorce, walked in and shot Minor and his brother in the head. Then he turned the gun on himself. Minor woke up in the hospital, where he was told that his brother and father were both dead. Minor couldn’t see the person who told him this.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe bullet had passed through Minor’s right temple and out the other side of his head, lodging itself in the palm of his hand.

He’s trying to build a career with a singular goal: to make it so blind people can play any game they want.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo the outsider, this sounds nonsensical. The “video” part of “video game” comes from the Latin for “see.” Isn’t it a bit unreasonable, expecting such a visual medium to be made blind-accessible? But Minor is making progress. He’s even becoming something of a celebrity in his field, with some impressive credits to his name: He consulted on Rare’s  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eSea of Thieves\u003c/em\u003e  and the Xbox game  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eAs Dusk Falls\u003c/em\u003e , narrated the audio description track for Netflix’s  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eAvatar: The Last Airbender\u003c/em\u003e , and is now working on a number of titles from well-known studios whose names I can’t print, due to nondisclosure agreements. Because of people like him, and a handful of sympathetic allies in the industry, there are now more options for blind gamers than ever.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMinor devotes most of his time to this work, something that not every blind or disabled person would be able to do. As Minor puts it, he is in a “privileged position”: Back when he was shot by his father, people weren’t quite as desensitized to gun violence, he says, and news about family-annihilation cases wasn’t so routine. People cared more. Local fundraising efforts established a college fund for him, with a small amount for emergencies.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStill, he struggles. Being disabled is expensive, and even with his various odd jobs in the video game industry, Minor still relies on survivor benefits, Social Security, and food stamps. In other words, he can barely afford to do this work at all. But he insists that he’s lucky to be able to try.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAt the pizza\u003c/span\u003e  place, Minor asks me to read the menu for him. If I wasn’t here, he’d have used an app on his phone that scans text and reads it aloud. It’d probably be faster that way—I’ve heard Minor use the app at other times, and he cranks the speed up so high that my ears only hear a spiky torrent of consonants. He’d have “seen” the whole menu by the time I finished dictating the appetizer section. It later occurs to me that sometimes when Minor asks a sighted person for help, it might actually be for our sake: to let  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eus\u003c/em\u003e  feel useful and included.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of the first things you’ll notice about Minor is a massive blue Gyarados tattoo on his right arm. It holds a few layers of meaning. Visually, a powerful water beast with wings makes sense for a swimmer. Minor picked up swimming during middle school, and he ended up being so good at it he earned a spot on the US Paralympic team. (When I first met him, in 2020, he was training for the Tokyo Olympics—a trip that never happened because he dropped out after what he describes as a long period of depression.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure class='AssetEmbedWrapper-eVDQiB byBkf asset-embed callout--group-item callout--group-item-1'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cpicture class='ResponsiveImagePicture-cWuUZO dUOtEa AssetEmbedResponsiveAsset-cXBNxi lqMXz asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image'\u003e\u003cimg src='https://media.wired.com/photos/684751d2b30ae2fd08b2c1ce/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Ross-Minor-Feature-Culture-4.jpg' alt='Image may contain Tho Becker Clothing Sleeve Person Sitting Teen Skin Tattoo Face Head Photography and Portrait'\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003ePhotograph: Darrell Jackson\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cfigure class='AssetEmbedWrapper-eVDQiB byBkf asset-embed callout--group-item callout--group-item-2'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cpicture class='ResponsiveImagePicture-cWuUZO dUOtEa AssetEmbedResponsiveAsset-cXBNxi lqMXz asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image'\u003e\u003cimg src='https://media.wired.com/photos/6847514bf478513e76dc19d8/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Ross-Minor-Feature-Culture-3.jpg' alt='Image may contain Clothing Pants Person Sitting Sleeve Face Head Photography Portrait Teen Skin Tattoo and Grass'\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003ePhotograph: Darrell Jackson\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut the tattoo’s bigger meaning is more straightforward: Gyarados is a Pokémon, and the  \u003cem class='italic'\u003ePokémon\u003c/em\u003e  video games changed Minor’s life. It began in the hospital, as he recovered. “I still don’t remember the specific day,” he says, setting down a slice of pizza. “It very much feels like a dream. But I remember one of my friends would visit me from school, and I just wanted to talk to him about  \u003cem class='italic'\u003ePokémon\u003c/em\u003e . So he would play his game for me next to the bed, and I would listen, and I realized that sometimes I could tell what was going on.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem class='italic'\u003ePokémon\u003c/em\u003e  was probably not designed to be blind-friendly. Instead, it’s what might be called “accidentally accessible.” Each Pokémon has a completely unique cry, a noise it makes when it’s summoned for battle. Bird-type Pokémon might have light and airy chiptune glissandos, while heavier rock-type ones tend more toward bass-heavy beeps and booms. Minor had already sunk hours into his own copy of  \u003cem class='italic'\u003ePokémon Ruby\u003c/em\u003e , so he recognized some of the cries from memory.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen Minor left the hospital, he and his mother moved into his grandparents’ home. “My mom brought over all my belongings and  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eRuby\u003c/em\u003e ,” he says. At first, he had a cousin play for him, and he would listen and explain what to do. Then he asked for the game. He wanted to try for himself.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis is where the most important part of  \u003cem class='italic'\u003ePokémon\u003c/em\u003e ’s accidental accessibility comes in: the bumps. When walking around in the overworld map, if your character runs into a wall, it makes a characteristic  \u003cem class='italic'\u003ebump\u003c/em\u003e  sound. Anyone who’s ever played the game probably heard the noise just now in their head. It’s simple, but it meant that Minor could walk around in the game, navigating by “feel.” Push up three times:  \u003cem class='italic'\u003enothing, nothing, bump\u003c/em\u003e . Hm. Push right:  \u003cem class='italic'\u003ebump\u003c/em\u003e . Push left:  \u003cem class='italic'\u003ebump\u003c/em\u003e . OK, this is a dead end. Turn around.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor a while after the shooting, Minor was afraid of adults. He would only talk to other children or his mother. Then, around the time Minor was relearning to play  \u003cem class='italic'\u003ePokémon\u003c/em\u003e , an elderly tutor came to visit him. “He gave me my first cane, but I wouldn’t even come out from under a blanket to say hi to him,” Minor says. “So he put the cane under the blanket so I could feel it. He was the one who showed me how to use it.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNext came the lessons. Once a week, the tutor would pull Minor out of class and they’d do an activity. One of his favorites was the clock game. The tutor would hide a wind-up clock somewhere, and Minor would have to find it by listening to the soft ticking. Minor learned to navigate new spaces by exploring them, gently bumping into walls and making mental maps. The experience felt familiar. Almost like  \u003cem class='italic'\u003ePokémon\u003c/em\u003e .\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen an odd thing happened: The real world got easier to navigate, but the worlds of video games did not. When in-game dialog boxes appeared, Minor would have to ask friends on the playground to read him the words. (Kids aren’t jaded yet, Minor observes now. They don’t mind.) Often, Minor found himself being talked about as an “inspiration”—for overcoming a tragic event, for playing sports, for playing guitar. But all Minor really wanted to talk about, then as now, were video games. And most of the games his friends were raving about were, for him, completely unplayable. Even  \u003cem class='italic'\u003ePokémon\u003c/em\u003e  got harder, as later iterations transitioned from grid-based 2D views to three dimensions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEvery so often, though, there were exceptions. “What really opened my eyes to what gaming could be was  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eLeft 4 Dead 2,\u003c/em\u003e ” Minor says. He still remembers the day: on a friend’s couch in high school, playing the “Dark Carnival” level. Usually, his friends spent the game protecting him, but this level proved to be too much for them. Zombies swarmed the arena. So Minor began listening for enemies and swinging his melee weapon. After an intense few minutes, he heard the sound of the level ending. “My friends were like, ‘Holy shit, Ross! You saved us!’”\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Dude, I loved that game,” he tells me. “I don’t want anyone’s pity. But, like, because of how inaccessible the world is, I’m always asking for help. So to actually help others, instead of being the one needing them—like, that’s a really, really cool feeling.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eIn his early\u003c/span\u003e  teens, Minor stumbled across an online forum for blind gamers. Before this, Minor would buy a game like one buys a lottery ticket, with the odds he’d be able to play it only slightly better. But here was a community—comparing notes, sharing workarounds, or just venting. Minor told every friend he could, though he assumed sighted gamers wouldn’t care. He’d tried writing emails to his favorite game studios, asking them to add features, volunteering to help them playtest. Occasionally he would get a courtesy email back:  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eWe’ll think about it.\u003c/em\u003e  “Other times,” Minor says, “I pour my heart out, and then I’d get an automated response.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen, in his senior year of high school, Minor posted to the Ask Me Anything subreddit, offering to talk about how he navigated life as a blind person. He expected people to be interested in how he played sports. To his surprise, more people seemed fascinated by the fact that he’d learned to play, yes, video games. At the request of multiple commenters, he managed to post a recording of himself playing  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eMortal Kombat X\u003c/em\u003e . Someone then offered to raise money for Minor to buy an Xbox One so he could stream online. He accepted.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThus  \u003ca href='https://www.youtube.com/@BlindRossMinor' class='link'\u003eMinor’s YouTube channel\u003c/a\u003e  was born, with a dual purpose: on the one hand, to offer tips for other blind gamers on how to navigate games; on the other, to be a public advocate for blind-accessible games. His following started to grow. (His YouTube channel now has more than 33,000 subscribers.) Perhaps because of this, developers started asking Minor to advise them on making their games more accessible. Minor realized that his lived experience might not be enough. He needed to know more about the craft. He bought books on game design and devoured them. He got every certificate he could think of. He found mentors who had been in the accessibility world longer than he had and asked for advice. He taught himself to program.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis was around the time Minor qualified for the Paralympics. I ask if he ever thought about using that as a platform. Go get a medal and  \u003cem class='italic'\u003ethen\u003c/em\u003e  advocate for his gaming hobby? People listen to athletes. Minor shakes his head. “It’s still not equal for us,” he says. “The Paralympics happens a month after the Olympics. And after the Olympics is over, nobody cares.” He adds: “Reach is what I care about.  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eReach\u003c/em\u003e  is what matters.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut more importantly, Minor wasn’t passionate about swimming. He was passionate about video games. And to hear Minor tell it, getting people to care about blind-accessible video games is a harder and more complicated task than Olympic-level swimming.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure class='AssetEmbedWrapper-eVDQiB byBkf asset-embed'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cpicture class='ResponsiveImagePicture-cWuUZO dUOtEa AssetEmbedResponsiveAsset-cXBNxi lqMXz asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image'\u003e\u003cimg src='https://media.wired.com/photos/684751d3b30ae2fd08b2c1cf/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Ross-Minor-Feature-Culture-9.jpg' alt='Image may contain Furniture Table Electronics Headphones Adult Person Desk Computer Hardware Hardware and Monitor'\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003ePhotograph: Darrell Jackson\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eMost modern video\u003c/span\u003e  games are built atop existing “engines”—a set of tools that provide basic gameplay mechanics. If you want to make a first-person shooter, you don’t have to code your shooter’s gait or the concept of “gravity” from scratch. Everything from  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eFortnite\u003c/em\u003e  to  \u003cem class='italic'\u003ePokémon Go\u003c/em\u003e  runs on these engines, and they formed the base tech for around 90 percent of the games released on Steam in 2024.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn theory, these engines could include built-in components for blind gamers: automatic screen-reader integrations, sonar-like environment-sensing toolkits.

As it stands, the handful of games that are truly blind-accessible—like  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eThe Last of Us 2\u003c/em\u003e , considered at the time of its release the gold standard—are built fully in-house, with proprietary engines; and there is no financial incentive to share designs with other companies.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo, how do you disrupt decades of industry inertia? A lot of patience, Minor says. He observes how other disability activists have done it for generations before him: You smile a lot and explain the same thing over and over and over again.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMinor’s first “job” was on  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eMadden NFL 18\u003c/em\u003e —he gave his feedback on a controller rumble feature and led a workshop. His name isn’t in the credits, and he received no money, only a tour of the offices and a signed copy of the game. (The devs did ask him to do more consulting work, but he passed the gig to a friend; Minor doesn’t care for football.) Though things have improved a bit, this isn’t unusual for the industry. Game studios often dangle “consulting” gigs at disabled gamers, only to sit them down with a controller, ask them questions for an hour, and then send them on their way with a gift card. Minor says he was once asked by a AAA game studio to travel across town to their offices to playtest a game—but the payment offered was so low that it wouldn’t even cover the Uber ride.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s a delicate dance. Minor, as well as other disability advocates I’ve spoken to—whether for blind or low-vision gamers, those with mobility or cognitive disabilities, or others—are sometimes hesitant to call out studios they’ve had bad experiences with. “There’s a sense that you shouldn’t bite the hand that feeds you,” Minor says. The concern, in other words, is that if disabled people are seen as being “ungrateful” for what they’ve been “given,” companies will simply turn their backs on them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBeyond that, it’s not enough to simply be good at a consulting job. To keep convincing game studios that accessibility is a worthwhile investment, one also has to be an “advocate,” and this means being a public figure. Or, in more relevant terms, an influencer.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis tricky landscape was something that one of Minor’s mentors was an expert at navigating. Brandon Cole, better known online as Superblindman, was one of the industry’s best-known blind accessibility consultants. He made a name for himself by being not only relentlessly friendly and optimistic but also phenomenal at his job. When Xbox announced that its flagship racing game  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eForza Motorsport\u003c/em\u003e  would be fully playable by blind gamers, nobody was surprised that Cole had been involved. Cole also worked on  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eThe Last of Us 2\u003c/em\u003e . He posted regularly on social media, spoke at events, and streamed on Twitch, all in the service of bringing awareness to the cause.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCole died of cancer in 2024. Minor, like most of the community, was gutted. He had lost someone he considered a friend and mentor. He also knew that he would be expected to step up and help continue the work that Cole left behind.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure class='AssetEmbedWrapper-eVDQiB byBkf asset-embed callout--group-item callout--group-item-1'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003eVideo: Dexter Thomas Jr.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cfigure class='AssetEmbedWrapper-eVDQiB byBkf asset-embed callout--group-item callout--group-item-2'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003eVideo: Dexter Thomas Jr.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eDid I mention\u003c/span\u003e  that Minor is funny? I know it’s a bit of a cliché to say this about a disabled person, but please indulge me here: Ross Minor is absolutely hilarious. As we walk home from the pizza spot, talking excitedly, I duck under a tree branch. Minor … doesn’t. He smacks right into it. I feel terrible: I should have warned him. He shakes his head. “Only thing worse than being a blind guy,” he says, spitting out an actual leaf, “is being a  \u003cem class='italic'\u003esix-foot-two\u003c/em\u003e  blind guy.” My favorite kind of joke: the sharp, uncomfortable kind that hinges on an experience your audience will  \u003cem class='italic'\u003enever\u003c/em\u003e  understand. The kind I occasionally tell in front of my white friends to watch them squirm, unsure if they’re allowed to laugh with me. I look at Minor: He’s giving me the same grin he gave the lady at the crosswalk. I finally break down and laugh.  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eRoss, you motherfucker.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMinor moved to Los Angeles three years ago, from Colorado, thinking it might help his career. And it has—up to a point. “Things have started to pick up for me when it comes to consulting and different gigs,” he says. “I feel like I’m really getting traction.” But because so much of his success is tied to his YouTube channel, other problems arise. “Video editing is not accessible,” he says. “Creating thumbnails—you know, they say that’s the hook, right?—that stuff’s not accessible.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen there’s the pressure to go viral. Recently, Minor uploaded a  \u003ca href='https://www.instagram.com/p/DCHj42aPhgt/' class='link'\u003evideo of himself beating a boss\u003c/a\u003e  in  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eGod of War: Ragnarok.\u003c/em\u003e  It’s pretty impressive: a professionally edited split screen with footage of his gameplay, combined with his voiceover explaining how the sound cues work. After a play-by-play of his finishing move, he speaks into the camera: “Gameplay is for everyone, and now you see.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe video flopped. “Not even a thousand views,” Minor says. “Meanwhile, I post a video about how I go down an escalator with my guide dog: 10,000 views.” He laughs, but he’s obviously frustrated. “Like, yeah, it gives people the warm fuzzies, like, ‘Oh, wow, he\u0026#39;s so inspirational.’ But that’s not the point.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe’re back at Minor’s house now, where he’s showing me his computer setup. Minor streams on Twitch regularly; he only took a break from streaming in January when the Los Angeles fires threatened his apartment. (He didn’t realize how close the fires were until someone told him—the bullet that took his vision also took out olfactory nerves, so he couldn’t smell the smoke.) He gestures toward his desk. He’s got a nice DSLR camera perched on a tripod, a ring light, a microphone. “A lot of this was given to me by the MrBeast foundation,” he says, referring to the nonprofit Beast Philanthropy, founded by its namesake, the famous YouTuber occasionally criticized for videos some people find exploitative. Minor admits he feels a little conflicted about getting such expensive items for free, but he’s also realistic. “It’s given me a lot of opportunities,” he says, “especially with my audio description work.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMinor does everything he can to make his Twitch streams look good for his sighted viewers. He sets up multicolored lights in the background, and he pays a small monthly fee for a service that makes them interactive—people in the Twitch chat can change the colors with a text command. Then there’s the “Dixie Cam,” an auxiliary camera pointed at his guide dog, Dixie. She’s a friendly black lab who seems to think of Minor’s streams as an opportunity to catch up on sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure class='AssetEmbedWrapper-eVDQiB byBkf asset-embed'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cpicture class='ResponsiveImagePicture-cWuUZO dUOtEa AssetEmbedResponsiveAsset-cXBNxi lqMXz asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image'\u003e\u003cimg src='https://media.wired.com/photos/684751cf610b41bca5227479/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Ross-Minor-Feature-Culture-8.jpg' alt='Image may contain Animal Canine Dog Labrador Retriever Mammal and Pet'\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003ePhotograph: Darrell Jackson\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eMinor occasionally even coordinates his outfits so that they stand out against the background. “I’m just checking to see what color my shirt is today,” he says. “I think it’s white.” He points his phone camera at himself, and a rapid-fire voice shouts a description into his ear. “Oh, it’s black. Well, there you go,” he shrugs, and chuckles.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eToday, he’s playing two games,  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eThe Last of Us 2\u003c/em\u003e  and  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eGod of War: Ragnorok\u003c/em\u003e . Midway through the first, as his character crawls through an abandoned storefront, Minor starts to answer messages from the chat. “What are the best games for PS5 for blind people?” he reads. He’s gotten this one before, but he answers it anyway. “Obviously the  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eLast of Us\u003c/em\u003e  games—wait, is this a rifle?” A pause while he listens to the screen reader. “Aw yeah.” He picks up the weapon, and as he does so, he hears the groan of a zombie in the distance. He stands up and headshots the enemy from across the room. He goes back to responding to the chat: “ … then  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eSpider-Man 2\u003c/em\u003e . Also  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eAs Dusk Falls\u003c/em\u003e . That’s both an accessible game and I advised on that.” He also shouts out  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eGod of War: Ragnarok\u003c/em\u003e , but with a caveat: “If you have a sighted person around occasionally, that would go a long way.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe’s not kidding. Half an hour after switching over to  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eGod of War\u003c/em\u003e , he gets stuck. Minor had been absolutely plowing through the game, using sound cues to mow down enemies, jump over obstacles, dodge projectiles. But now his session has come to an abrupt halt. “Hey guys,” he says, talking to the handful of people in the chat. “Uh … did my computer freeze?”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt did not. His character is simply dangling from a ledge, and there is no sound to indicate what is going on. Minor has come up against the only foe he can’t beat: silence. Without a cue to let him know he can safely drop down, he’s stuck.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn that moment, I think about another game,  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eSea of Thieves,\u003c/em\u003e  in which teams form pirate crews and rove around in the ocean. It seems like it would be unplayable for a blind person. And for the person steering the boat, it largely was, because the sea is full of randomly placed rocks. Then Minor sat down with the developers and suggested they add a setting to amplify the volume of the crashing waves, and put it in stereo. Now he could  \u003cem class='italic'\u003ehear\u003c/em\u003e  rocks, and what side they were approaching from. If you’ve played  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eSea of Thieves\u003c/em\u003e  with strangers, there’s a chance the player driving the boat was blind.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMinor’s work often involves stuff like this: cleaning up a well-intended dev’s mess; proposing an elegant (read: inexpensive) way to add accessibility to a game that was not created with him in mind. Minor doesn’t want to dumb down a game, even though that’s what consultants are occasionally asked to do. Blind gamers don’t want a guided tour; they want the same thing every other gamer wants—the fun of exploring, the challenge of figuring things out, the joy of finally beating a level.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut he’ll take the jobs he’s given, and had  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eGod of War\u003c/em\u003e  had him on call, blind people wouldn’t be left hanging. Mercifully, today, sighted people are here to help. Someone in the chat chimes in, and text-to-speech voice reads into Minor’s ear: “ \u003cem class='italic'\u003eYou’re on a ledge, just jump down.\u003c/em\u003e ” Minor taps a button, and the game continues. He goes on to face off against a section boss, who launches into a series of frost wind attacks. “It sounds like ice,” he says, marveling at the sound design. “I can hear it sparkling and crunching when it whooshes past me.” He beats her in a few tries.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure class='AssetEmbedWrapper-eVDQiB byBkf asset-embed callout--group-item callout--group-item-1'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cpicture class='ResponsiveImagePicture-cWuUZO dUOtEa AssetEmbedResponsiveAsset-cXBNxi lqMXz asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image'\u003e\u003cimg src='https://media.wired.com/photos/684751cf2806a2eb4b7b2315/4:3/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Ross-Minor-Feature-Culture-13.jpg' alt='Image may contain Electrical Device Microphone Person Teen Electronics Headphones Accessories Bracelet and Jewelry'\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003ePhotograph: Darrell Jackson\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cfigure class='AssetEmbedWrapper-eVDQiB byBkf asset-embed callout--group-item callout--group-item-2'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cpicture class='ResponsiveImagePicture-cWuUZO dUOtEa AssetEmbedResponsiveAsset-cXBNxi lqMXz asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image'\u003e\u003cimg src='https://media.wired.com/photos/684751d1a97cf00f82f55b02/4:3/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Ross-Minor-Feature-Culture-12.jpg' alt='Image may contain Electronics Headphones Camera Computer Computer Hardware Computer Keyboard Hardware and Adult'\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003ePhotograph: Darrell Jackson\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eNear the end\u003c/span\u003e  of our time together, I ask Minor what his mother thinks about all of this. She’s gotta be proud. Who else can honestly say their son is a trailblazer in a multibillion-dollar industry? “We butt heads sometimes,” he says. This tracks with what almost every game developer I’ve ever interviewed has told me. Parents  \u003cem class='italic'\u003enever\u003c/em\u003e  understand.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut I suppose Minor’s case is a little different. “Like, everyone wants this inspirational story about how we stuck it through and how we’re closer because of it,” he says. “But it’s like—dude, what happened was traumatic. Like, we’re damaged from what happened.” For years, Minor’s mom told him his work was a waste of time. “I spent all my time making my YouTube videos, all my time playing video games. And she’s like, ‘You need to get an education. You need to find a job.’ She wasn’t wrong.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eMinor’s mom is more understanding of his goals now, he says, as he has found some success. I ask Minor if he’d like to become more famous. Perhaps he could be a content creator and, on the side, still do consulting work for some big game companies. He interrupts me before I can even finish the question. “I want a regular job, dude.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWorking at a studio, Minor would be able to directly influence how gameplay is developed. Not making a “patch,” but building an experience with both sighted  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eand\u003c/em\u003e  blind people in mind, from the ground up. And if the game was successful, other companies would imitate it. New industry standards.

Probably the first in the industry, actually. But, again, he’s not really interested in that. He’d rather just be another guy in the credits. I think he’s struggling with the fact that I’m writing this very story, that the spotlight is, for the moment, entirely on him. “The attention,” he starts, then pauses, looking for the right words. “I don’t want to say it’s  \u003cem class='italic'\u003enice\u003c/em\u003e , but it is validating.

And it’s not just skills related to AI literacy—people skills are rising in importance. Our data shows the top skills that professionals think will become more important as AI tools become more widely used at work are problem solving, strategic thinking, and time management.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs for employers, the rise of AI only increases the importance of a skills-based approach to hiring and developing talent. People are learning AI skills at a rapid clip, with the number of AI-skilled members now nine times larger than it was in 2016. And there is a hunger to put these newly developed skills into practice: LinkedIn job posts that mention artificial intelligence or generative AI have seen  \u003ca href='https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/global-talent-trends' class='link'\u003e17 percent greater application growth\u003c/a\u003e  over the past two years than job posts with no mentions of the technology.

Leaders and employees need to think of AI as just one tool in the toolbox. It doesn’t replace people, it allows them to do their job more effectively, leaving them time to focus on the more valuable—and more human—parts of their jobs. For instance, a software engineer can have AI help with the more routine or repetitive coding that’s regularly required, giving them more time to innovate on new ideas. Or a recruiter can save time and focus on the more strategic parts of the hiring process—like speaking to and building relationships with candidates—by letting AI handle the creation of job postings.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn 2024, leaders will lean into this ever-evolving technology while simultaneously empowering their employees, and people will align their skill-building and continuing education with AI skills and practical people skills.

For me, it\u0026#39;s these “cooling blankets” that people talk about on social media. I mean, it sounds great for summer—just like a blanket that warms you up but in reverse.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSadly, these products don’t do what they claim. They might be breathable so they don’t make you as hot as an ordinary blanket would, but you’d still be cooler with no blanket at all. However, there is hope. Someone has created a  \u003cem class='italic'\u003ereal\u003c/em\u003e  cooling blanket that\u0026#39;s sort of awesome. Of course, there\u0026#39;s a bunch of physics here, so let\u0026#39;s get to it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2 class='text-xl font-semibold'\u003eTemperature vs. Energy\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem class='italic'\u003eTemperature\u003c/em\u003e  is one of those words everyone uses and no one understands. In chemistry it’s the average kinetic energy, or vibrational motion, of the molecules in a substance. The greater the commotion, the higher the temperature.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut I like this more pragmatic definition: Temperature is the property two objects will have in common when they’re in contact for a long time. So, if you take a hot block of metal and set it against a cold block of metal, eventually they will have the same temperature. Heat flows from the warmer thing to the cooler thing until they equalize. (Note: It doesn’t work the other way around; you can’t transfer “coolness.”)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe also talk about objects having a certain amount of  \u003cem class='italic'\u003ethermal energy\u003c/em\u003e , which you’d get by adding up the kinetic energy of all the particles inside it. It depends on three things: the mass of the object, its temperature, and the material it’s made of. So for instance, focusing on mass, big potatoes have more thermal energy than small potatoes at the same temperature.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow, if you look at the type of material, every substance has a “specific heat capacity,” which is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of that substance by one degree. Try this at home. Find two objects that have been sitting in your room for a while, so they’re both at room temperature. Here, I have a block of wood and a block of aluminum.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cfigure class='AssetEmbedWrapper-eVDQiB byBkf asset-embed'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cpicture class='ResponsiveImagePicture-cWuUZO dUOtEa AssetEmbedResponsiveAsset-cXBNxi lqMXz asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image'\u003e\u003cimg src='https://media.wired.com/photos/684b0d5f984c1e37fc9b9616/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/woodaluminum.png' alt='Image may contain Food Wood Chopping Board and Cheese'\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cp\u003eCourtesy of Rhett Allain\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eTouch both objects. They’re the same temperature, but the wood  \u003cem class='italic'\u003efeels\u003c/em\u003e  warmer, right? Why is that? It\u0026#39;s not about temperature but thermal energy. When your hand touches an object, there is a heat conduction interaction. Energy is transferred from your warmer hand to the cooler object until the two are the same temperature. However, with the metal block it takes way more energy to reach the temperature of your hand. It feels cooler because it causes your hand to lose more energy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou’ll notice the same thing when you go swimming. An air temperature of 75°F feels nice and comfortable, but wading into water of the same temperature feels really cold. That\u0026#39;s because water has a much higher mass and specific heat capacity than air, which causes you to lose more thermal energy and feel colder.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 class='text-xl font-semibold'\u003eAll Blankets Cool\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo, blankets, how do they work? A blanket is basically an insulator. That means it prevents energy transfer between objects at different temperatures. Wrapping yourself in a blanket on a cold day keeps you from losing body heat to the air around you, so you feel warmer. Similarly, if you put a blanket around a cold soda on a warm day, it will slow down the transfer of thermal energy from the air to the soda, keeping the soda  \u003cem class='italic'\u003ecold\u003c/em\u003e  longer.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut what if you feel hot and you put on a blanket? In that case, two things can happen at once. It can still act as a thermal insulator and slow down the transfer of energy between you and the air. Unless the ambient air is above 98.5°F, this is going to make you hotter, not cooler.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, the blanket can also have a thermal interaction with your body. Suppose you have a 80°F blanket in contact with a 98°F person. This will raise the temperature of the blanket while reducing the thermal energy of your body. Yes, it will act as a cooling blanket—at least for a few minutes, until the temperatures are equalized.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo, what makes one blanket cool more effectively than another? First, it should have a high mass, so that it takes a lot of energy to warm up. Second, the blanket needs to make good contact with your skin to increase the thermal interaction. So, one of those light fluffy blankets won\u0026#39;t cool you off that much. Other than that, it\u0026#39;s just a normal blanket.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut I\u0026#39;m a sucker for trying these things, so I bought a cheap “cooling blanket” online. (I know, someone will say it doesn\u0026#39;t work unless you get an expensive one.) For those who say their cooling blanket was out in the sun and they measured a 75°F temperature, I don\u0026#39;t believe you. Check this out. I have three blankets on my sofa. One of them is the cooling blanket and the others are normal.

Yes, this is a thing—it\u0026#39;s called a phase transition. It happens whenever a material changes from solid to liquid or liquid to gas.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHere\u0026#39;s an interesting experiment. Imagine I take a beaker with frozen water (aka ice) that\u0026#39;s colder than the freezing point (maybe –10°C).

Why is that? It’s because the energy is being used to break the molecular bonds and turn the solid into a liquid. Once it’s entirely liquid, the temperature starts rising again—until it reaches the boiling point (100°C). Again, the temperature levels off until all the water turns to gas. (This is why it\u0026#39;s nice to cook with boiling water—it stays the same temperature.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou can see how this would make for a better cooling blanket.

AI models need more and more data to improve, but OpenAI has already used the easy sources; finding new piles of written text to use won’t be easy or free. Legal challenges also loom: OpenAI is training its system on text and images that may be under copyright, perhaps even created by the very same people whose jobs are at risk from this technology. And as more online content is created using AI, it creates a feedback loop in which the online data-training models won’t be created by humans, but by machines.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eData aside, there’s a fundamental problem with such language models: They spit out text that reads well enough but is not necessarily accurate. As smart as these models are, they don’t know what they’re saying or have any concept of truth—that’s easily forgotten amid the mad rush to make use of such tools for new businesses or to create content.

Christmas Day—particularly the evening—was the best game time of the year. It’s always been a bit of a holiday within the holiday for serious players. The tradition revolves around a phenomenon called “Christmas Noobs.” At Christmas, so many new players receive new games and consoles that online games are flooded with a tidal wave of gamers who often fumble their way through the top games and act like cannon fodder for the waiting legions of seasoned veterans. Mustafa and his mates were skilled at  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eCall of Duty: Advanced Warfare\u003c/em\u003e . “We were all ready for a night of easy wins, quick XP [experience points] farming, and were looking forward to leveling up like crazy.” So, they waited like crocodiles anticipating herds of migrating buffalo to enter the river. But just as the bullets started flying they were all unceremoniously chucked out of their matches and knocked offline. “None of us could log back in, and party chat was down too, so we couldn’t even talk to each other to figure out what was happening,” Mustafa said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt was all over social media: A group of hackers called Lizard Squad were bragging about their massive DDoS attack on Xbox Live and PlayStation Network—the crucial services that linked tens of millions of gamers to the Microsoft and Sony servers. Mustafa had seen that the group had already carried out smaller-scale attacks and had for weeks been taunting and threatening a big attack. Apparently it was all linked to some silly and incomprehensible spat with a rival but minor hacking group. Mustafa was angry but also fascinated by the attack and the incredible reaction online. “The fallout was instantaneous. People were furious,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePlayStation Network at the time had about 110 million subscribers, and Xbox Live had roughly 48 million. Xbox was back to normal within 24 hours—on Boxing Day. But PlayStation struggled for longer. It didn’t just affect existing subscribers. Before you can use any new games, consoles, or vouchers, you need to register them via the gaming company’s servers. It was a catastrophe for the games industry, especially Sony, which had already been having a tough time after a different cyberattack the previous month.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eServices were down around the world.

They showed zero remorse for the impact they’d had on people around the world. Twelve hours later I walked into the newsroom and was given the seemingly impossible task of “getting a Lizard” on the evening TV bulletin at Sky News.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt took hours of trawling Twitter and speaking to dozens of wannabes and fakes, but I eventually succeeded in finding contact details for a British man called Vinnie Omari. Incredibly, he lived a few miles from our newsroom in west London. He agreed to come to us for the interview and was pale, skinny, wore all black and talked fast. He was at pains to distance himself from the gang but left the studios promising that a Lizard Squad hacker called “Ryan” would be in touch. I had no idea at the time of course that this “Ryan” was Julius Kivimäki—an already infamous teenage hacker and delinquent from Finland. It was later that afternoon—at around 3 pm —that “Ryan” called through on Skype. Just in time for us to edit our conversation with him into our news piece.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe 17-year-old looked very young and pale and had a shaved head and soft features. In spite of everything, he was polite and seemed in no rush. But he was also utterly unremorseful and arrogant, struggling to stifle a smirk throughout the interview. When I started by asking him why he wanted to ruin Christmas for tens of millions of people, he gave me the same boilerplate answer about the boys doing it to amuse themselves and embarrass these tech mega corps. “These companies make tens of millions every month from just their subscriber fees, and they should have more than enough funding to be able to protect against these attacks.” We went back and forth for about 15 minutes without him giving any hint of regret or awareness for how many people had been affected by his stunt.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“I’d be worried if those people didn’t have anything better to do than play games on their consoles at Christmas Eve and Christmas Day,” he said. “I mean, I can’t really say I feel bad. I might have forced a couple of kids to spend their time with their families instead of playing games.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe interview blew up online, with more than a million views on YouTube and thousands of comments on Twitter, where many four-letter words were hurled at the Lizards. PlayStation and Xbox also received a torrent of abuse. Later they would offer a five-day extension to players’ subscription periods and 10 percent off as compensation. The resulting bill for the company must easily have been in the millions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eKivimäki went on to speak to other reporters, sometimes calling himself Ryan Cleary (a reference to another hacker he had vague and likely acrimonious link to from a previous teen hacker gang called LulzSec). In one interview and debate on YouTube channel DramaAlert he is implored by Kim Dotcom to stop the silly hacker rivalries that were impacting so many innocent people. “Hackers used to be respected; they used to have a magic about them,” Kim said, accusing Lizard Squad of harming the image of hackers around the world with their actions. Kivimäki’s response is fascinating: He laughed it off as old-fashioned thinking. “It’s wrong to connect groups like Lizard Squad with, for example, L0pht from a couple of decades back,” he said. “There’s really no connection with the hacking groups of today and the hacking groups of two decades ago. The meaning is totally different now.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlthough many security experts angrily railed against the media’s portrayal of Lizard Squad as “sophisticated,” people grudgingly came to accept that the Christmas attack did have a big impact on cybersecurity and the gaming industry. There’s little doubt that this was not the group’s motive—despite their clumsy attempts to claim so in interviews. But it was a wake-up call. Security website SecurityAffairs wrote a “lessons learned” piece by dissecting my interview with Kivimäki. Many people considered Lizard Squad script kiddies, they wrote, adding, “This approach is totally wrong.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe size of the attack unleashed on that day would be shrugged off by most modern sites, but DDoS attacks are still commonplace and are getting more powerful. Expensive protection services are now a must-have for any organization that needs to stay online.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe attacks also started something of a cybercrime trend. In 2024 Europol unveiled an international law enforcement operation to take DDoS services down in December: “The festive season has long been a peak period for hackers to carry out some of their most disruptive DDoS attacks, causing severe financial loss, reputational damage, and operational chaos for their victims,” the organization  \u003ca href='https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/law-enforcement-shuts-down-27-ddos-booters-ahead-of-annual-christmas-attacks' class='link'\u003esaid in a statement\u003c/a\u003e .\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAt the time\u003c/span\u003e  of Lizard Squad’s attacks, the general public was stunned. Despite Lizard Squad being on the tail end of a wave of teenage hacking groups in the 2010s, there was little awareness of the power that could be wielded by these otherwise amateur attackers. There might have been a vague feeling in the zeitgeist that “hackers in hoodies in their bedrooms” were increasingly causing problems, but this attack was immediate, unmissable, and easy to understand. It was of course also easy to get angry about. Over the next couple of days I came back to the story with follow-ups about the fallout as other Lizard Squad members spoke to YouTubers about the so-called “drama.” But the big thing the newsroom kept asking me was, When would these kids be arrested?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eVinnie Omari was the first. On New Year’s Eve he was raided by the South East Regional Organized Crime Unit, which collared him on suspicion of cyber fraud offenses committed in 2013 and 2014. It looked like the raid was for other alleged offenses involving PayPal fraud, but the search warrant, which later surfaced online, also referenced the Christmas DDoS attacks. “They took everything: Xbox One, phones, laptops, computer USBs, etc.,” Omari told reporter William Turton from the Daily Dot. He was later cleared of any involvement.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter Omari’s arrest, other Lizards were taken out too. On January 16, 2015, police announced that they had arrested an 18-year-old in Southport, near Liverpool. They didn’t give a name, but reporters at the Daily Mail identified him: “The ‘quiet’ teenager, named locally as Jordan Lee-Bevan, was arrested during a raid at his semi-detached home in Southport, Merseyside, today, with officers seizing computers as he was taken away in a police car.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn 2016 teenager Zachary Buchta from Maryland was also arrested for his role in Lizard Squad and another group called PoodleCorp. As a boy he had been warned in 2014 about his criminal path by police who had caught him carrying out minor cybercrime activity. But he was undeterred and even changed his Twitter profile at one stage to @fbiarelosers to taunt the cops.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt the same time that Buchta was arrested, Dutch police raided and arrested another 19-year-old. Bradley van Rooy, who used the names “Uchiha” or “UchihaLS,” was accused of conspiring with other members of Lizard Squad to operate websites that provided cyberattack-for-hire services, facilitating thousands of DDoS attacks and trafficking stolen payment card account information for thousands of victims.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBradley was put on bail for two years and eventually given a two-year suspended sentence and 180 hours of community service. The vast majority of charges against him were dropped as they had taken place when he was a minor. He ended up being convicted of the DDoS-for-hire operation and handling stolen credit cards. I tracked him down, and he openly talked about that period of his life, which he had put behind him a long time ago. “I’m now 27, and I see the damage that I did and understand that there could have been a higher punishment,” he says. “But then I also see that I was just a kid, and I had a troubled time at school and just fell into the hacking life after meeting the wrong people when I was playing the game  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eRuneScape\u003c/em\u003e .”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBradley’s journey and words track so perfectly to the experiences of almost every hacker I have met or interviewed. It’s as though there is a universal constant, whereby a subset of gamers in every generation is pulled into cybercrime in exactly the same way. There are literally billions of gamers in the world, so these people represent only a tiny fraction. But it seems to be inevitable and cyclical as hacker groups rise and fall.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe differentiating and more important aspect, though, is how these boys and young men react when they cross the line and are caught.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo what of Julius Kivimäki, aka “Ryan,” aka “Ryan Cleary” and many other aliases including the by now infamous “Zeekill”?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSurely, after appearing on TV and radio admitting that he was part of the gang, he too would be rearrested sharpish? Officers did indeed visit Kivimäki to interview him, but they did not arrest him—contrary to reports in the international media. It’s not clear why they took no further action, but perhaps when the teenager confidently said that police would find nothing on his computer he was right. “They’d have to let me go,” he had cockily asserted in our interview. If so, maybe his run-in with police years earlier had taught him to cover his tracks more effectively. Or maybe he hadn’t taken as much of a leading role in the DDoS attacks as he had claimed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor Finnish cybercrime cop Antti Kurittu, seeing Kivimäki on TV was especially galling. Antti had raided and arrested Kivimaki two years earlier for other cyberattacks carried out with a different teenage cyber gang called HTP. “I remember watching your Sky News interview and just thinking ‘wow, this guy is not even trying to cover up his crimes. He’s just a different sort of person,’” Antti recalls.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt wasn’t until July 2015 that Kivimäki received his first criminal conviction. He was found guilty of the rather preposterous total of 50,700 instances of aggravated computer break-ins—one for every computer enslaved into HTPs botnet. He was also convicted of other offenses including data breach, money laundering, and being in possession of, and using, stolen credit cards. For all of these offenses, he was handed a two-year suspended sentence. If he had been an adult he could have got years behind bars, but as a minor and first-time offender he served no time in prison. So Kivimäki, just a few weeks from his 18th birthday, remained free. He began calling himself the “Untouchable Hacker God” on Twitter.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA year after Kivimäki’s sentencing, in a bizarre coincidence, Antti bumped into Kivimäki in Amsterdam. It was April 2016 and Antti was walking through the departures lounge of Schiphol Airport when he passed the by-then 18-year-old. Antti did a double take, gobsmacked to see him. It was so surreal that they both found it amusing and took a selfie. After a short chat, Antti asked Kivimäki if he was now “staying out of trouble.” Kivimäki replied, “Of course.” But when Antti asked him for a contact email address, he made one up with “@FBI.gov” at the end. They laughed and went their separate ways.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut, as Antti predicted, the Untouchable Hacker God would be back. Four years later he was. And this time he was linked to the cruelest cyberattack in history and had a new alias: ransom_man.\u003c/p\u003e\u003chr class='my-4 border-t border-gray-300'\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem class='italic'\u003eExcerpt adapted from\u003c/em\u003e  Ctrl+Alt+Chaos: How Teenage Hackers Hijack the Internet  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eby Joe Tidy.

Having spent most of my career on the inside of online extremist movements, I certainly can. The year 2024 might be the one in which neo-Nazis, jihadists, and conspiracy theorists turn their utopian visions of creating their own self-governed states into reality—not offline, but in the form of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDAOs are digital entities that are collaboratively governed without central leadership and operate based on blockchain. They allow internet users to establish their own organizational structures, which no longer require the involvement of a third party in financial transactions and rulemaking. The World Economic Forum  \u003ca href='https://www.weforum.org/reports/decentralized-autonomous-organization-toolkit/' class='link'\u003edescribed DAOs\u003c/a\u003e  as “an experiment to reimagine how we connect, collaborate and create”.

So far, DAOs have attracted a wild mix of libertarians, activists, pranksters, and hobbyists. Most DAOs I have come across in my research sound innocent and fun. Personally, my favorites include theCaféDAO, which aims “to replace Starbucks” (good luck with that!); the Doge DAO, which wants to “make the Doge meme the most recognizable piece of art in the world”; and the HairDAO, “a decentralized asset manager solving hair loss.” But some DAOs use a more radical tone. For example, the Redacted Club DAO, which is rife with alt-right codes and conspiracy myth references, claims to be a secret network with the aim of “slaying” the “evil Meta Lizard King.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003caside class='Sidebar-pgAgH kmwJca'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eREAD MORE\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis story is from the  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/wired-world' class='link'\u003eWIRED World in 2024\u003c/a\u003e , our annual trends briefing.

Policies, legal contracts, and financial transactions that were traditionally the domain of governments, courts, and banks can be replaced with smart contracts, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and cryptocurrencies. The use of anonymous bitcoin wallets and non-transparent cryptocurrencies such as Monero is already widespread among extremists whose bank accounts have been frozen. A shift to entirely decentralized forms of self-governance is only one step away.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eBeyond practical reasons that encourage extremists to create their own self-governed structures, there is an ideological incentive too: their fundamental distrust in the establishment. If you believe that the deep state or the “global Jewish elites” control everything from governments and Big Tech to the global banking system, DAOs offer an appealing alternative. Conversations on far-right fringe platforms such as BitChute and Odysee reveal that there is much appetite for decentralized alternative forms of collaboration, communication, and crowdfunding.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo what happens if anti-minority groups establish their own digital worlds in which they impose their own governing mechanisms? What are the stakes if trolling armies start cooperating via DAOs to launch election interference campaigns? The activities of extremist DAOs could challenge the rule of law, pose a threat to minority groups, and disrupt institutions that are currently considered fundamental pillars of democratic systems. Another risk is that DAOs can serve as safe havens for extremist movements by enabling users to circumvent government regulation and security services monitoring activities. They might also allow extremists to find new ways to fundraise, plan, and plot radicalization campaigns or even attacks. While many governments have focused on developing legal frameworks to regulate AI, few have even recognized the existence of DAOs. Their looming exploitation for extremist and criminal purposes is something that has flown under the radar of global policymakers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eTechnology expert Carl Miller, who has long warned of potential misuse of DAOs, told me that “even though DAOs behave like companies, they are not registered as legal entities.” There are only a few exceptions: The US states of Wyoming, Vermont, and Tennessee have passed laws to legally recognize DAOs. With no regulations in place to hold DAOs accountable for extremist or criminal activities, the big question for 2024 will be: How can we ensure the metaverse doesn’t give rise to digital white ethnostates or cyber caliphates?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","publishedAt":"2024-01-24T12:00:00Z","categories":["Ideas","WIRED World"],"keywords":["climate change, Infrastructure, Cities, transportation, Electric Vehicles","science, Energy, physics, Power","artificial intelligence, Work, communication, productivity, Jobs","The WIRED World in 2024, politics, Web3"]},{"title":"This Chinese Spacecraft Is Traveling to One of Earth’s Quasi-Moons","description":"The Tianwen-2 probe has sent a self-portrait as it heads toward one of the most enigmatic objects in our space neighborhood: the quasi-moon Kamo‘oalewa.","link":"https://www.wired.com/story/chinese-spacecraft-earths-quasi-moons-china-tianwen-2/","body":"\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eAll products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors.

Two years later, Ethereum unveiled its platform for “smart contracts,” software applications that can enforce an agreement without human intervention. For example, you could create a smart contract to bet on tomorrow’s weather. You and your gambling partner would upload the contract to the Ethereum network and then send a little digital currency, which the software would essentially hold in escrow. The next day, the software would check the weather and send the winner their earnings. A number of “prediction markets” have been built on the platform, enabling people to bet on more interesting outcomes, such as which political party will win an election.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs long as the software is written correctly, there’s no need to trust anyone in these transactions.

Thrown off the platform after the January 6 insurrection, Trump moved to the much smaller Truth Social, a network whose main selling point seemed to be his presence. Trump lost something precious when he was deplatformed: the ability to speak to the “big room”—a platform that reached a broad swath of the people interested in public affairs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eBig-room spaces, like Twitter and Instagram, are continual battlegrounds for attention. They’re invaluable for activists, who want messages like #MeToo and #BlackLivesMatter to reach new converts to the movement, and for influencers who build power and revenue by building audiences. But they are also inherently conflicted spaces, as people of different points of view spar over what types of speech are appropriate for the space.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003caside class='Sidebar-pgAgH kmwJca'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eREAD MORE\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis story is from the  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/wired-world' class='link'\u003eWIRED World in 2024\u003c/a\u003e , our annual trends briefing.

Elon Musk’s compulsive destruction of Twitter is turning it into a smaller room, a safe space for extremists that makes it unsafe for those who don’t share their views. Reddit, long one of the most exciting spaces for informed, topical conversations, is shedding users as it implements unpopular, Muskian policies in hopes of generating much-needed revenue. Some subreddits are migrating to Discord, where their conversations won’t overlap with thousands of other topics on Reddit, but where they have full control over their chosen rules of the road.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSmall-room networks can be deeply important spaces for communities to find support and solidarity. When you seek support for living with diabetes or without alcohol (two struggles I’m personally engaged in), you’re not looking for confrontation, but for camaraderie, comfort, and constructive advice. Millions of us find these spaces in subreddits, Facebook groups, or even on special-purpose social networks, such as Archive of One’s Own, which links together 5 million fan-fiction authors and fans each month.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut small rooms have a big downside: They’re as useful for Nazis as they are for knitters. These conversations, insulated from outside scrutiny, can normalize extreme points of view and lead people deeper into dark topics they expressed a passing interest in.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe need small-room networks—they introduce strangers to one another, building social capital and connection between people who might never interact in the physical world.

If you do need a phone for coordination or as a way to call friends or a lawyer in case of an emergency, keep it off as much as possible to reduce the chances that it connects to a rogue cell tower or Wi-Fi hot spot being used by law enforcement for surveillance. Sort out logistics with friends in advance so you only need to turn your phone on if something goes awry. Or to be even more certain that your phone won’t be tracked, keep it in a Faraday bag that blocks all of its radio communications. Open the bag only when necessary.

Your main smartphone likely has the majority of your digital accounts and data on it, all of which law enforcement could conceivably access if they confiscate your phone. But don’t assume that any backup phone you buy will grant you anonymity. If you give a prepaid carrier your identifying details, after all, your “burner” phone could be no more anonymous than your primary device. “Don’t expect because you got it from Duane Reade that you’re automatically a character from  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eThe Wire\u003c/em\u003e ,” Holmes cautions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eInstead of a burner phone, Holmes argues that it may be far more practical to simply own a secondary phone that you’ve set up to be less sensitive—leaving off accounts and apps that offer your most private information to anyone who seizes it, such as social media, email, and messaging apps. “Choosing a secondary device that limits the amount of personal data that you have on you at all times is probably your best protection,” Holmes says.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRegardless of what phone you’re using, consider that traditional calls and text messages are vulnerable to surveillance. That means you need to use end-to-end encryption. Ideally, you and those you communicate with should use disappearing messages set to self-delete after a few hours or days. The encrypted messaging and calling app  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/signal-tips-private-messaging-encryption/' class='link'\u003eSignal\u003c/a\u003e  has  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/signal-encrypted-messaging-features-mainstream/' class='link'\u003eperhaps the best and longest track record\u003c/a\u003e . Just make sure you and the people you’re communicating with are using the same app, since they’re not interoperable.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAside from protecting your phone’s communications from surveillance, be prepared in the event police seize your device and try to unlock it in search of incriminating evidence. The first order of business is to make sure your smartphone’s contents are encrypted. iOS devices have full disk encryption on by default if you enable an access lock. For Android phones, go to  \u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eSettings\u003c/strong\u003e , then  \u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eSecurity\u003c/strong\u003e  to make sure the  \u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eEncrypt Disk\u003c/strong\u003e  option is turned on. (These steps may differ depending on your specific device.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRegardless of your operating system, always protect devices with a long, strong passcode rather than a fingerprint or face unlock. As convenient as biometric unlocking methods are, it may be more difficult to resist an officer forcing your thumb onto your phone’s sensor, for instance, than to refuse to tell them a passcode. So if you use biometrics day-to-day for convenience, disable them before heading into a protest.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you insist on using biometric unlocking methods to have faster access to your devices, keep in mind that some phones have an emergency function to disable these types of locks. Hold the wake button and one of the volume buttons simultaneously on an iPhone, for instance, and it will lock itself and require a passcode to unlock rather than FaceID or TouchID, even if they’re enabled. Most devices also let you take photos or record video without unlocking them first, a good way to keep your phone locked as much as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 class='text-xl font-semibold'\u003eYour Face\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eFace recognition has become one of the most powerful tools to identify your presence at a protest.

For those of you in the most sensitive positions—such as undocumented immigrants at risk of deportation—she suggests that you consider staying home rather than depend on any obfuscation technique to mask their presence at an event.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you’re driving a car to a protest—your own or someone else’s—consider that  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/license-plate-reader-live-video-data-exposed/' class='link'\u003eautomatic license plate readers\u003c/a\u003e  can easily identify the vehicle’s movements.

Now things have changed.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 class='text-xl font-semibold'\u003eYour Online Footprint\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThough most privacy and security considerations for attending an in-person protest naturally relate to your body, any devices you bring with you, and your physical surroundings, there are a set of other factors to think about online. It’s important to understand how posts on social media and other platforms before, during, or after a protest could be collected and used by authorities to identify and track you or others. Simply saying on an online platform that you are attending or attended a protest puts the information out there. And if you take photos or videos during a protest, that content could be used to expand law enforcement’s view of who attended a protest and what they did while there, including any strangers who appear in your images or footage.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAuthorities can come to your online presence by looking for information about you in particular, but can also arrive there using bulk data analysis tools like Dataminr that offer law enforcement and other customers real-time monitoring connecting people to their online activity. Such tools can also surface past posts, and if you’ve ever made violent comments online or alluded to committing crimes—even as a joke—law enforcement could discover the activity and use it against you if you are questioned or arrested during a protest. This is a particular concern for people living in the US on visas or those whose immigration status is tenuous.

Make sure you have permission to photograph or videotape any fellow protesters who would be potentially identifiable in your content. Also think carefully before livestreaming. It’s important to document what’s going on but difficult to be sure that everyone who could show up in your stream is comfortable being included.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEven if you take photos and videos that you don’t plan to post on social media or otherwise share, remember that this media could fall into law enforcement’s hands if they demand access to your device.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith federal crackdowns on protests ramping up around the country, Cyberlixir’s Vo says that people must assess each situation and weigh the benefits of maintaining personal privacy versus chronicling the reality of what’s happening at protests.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Social media monitoring and online profiling is the factor that lots of people forget. Those who publish footage on social media should avoid sharing photos or videos that reveal people\u0026#39;s faces,” she says. “But I also believe that documenting what’s going on is essential, especially in high-risk conditions, because when the state escalates we need proof for legal defense, for public record, for future organizing, and also to keep ourselves physically safe in real time.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs protests continue—with the real possibility of even further escalated response from the Trump administration—be prepared for the emergence of forms of digital surveillance that have never been used in the US before to counter civil disobedience or to retaliate against protesters after the fact.

All the carriers began by building 5G atop their existing networks, which provided lots of connectivity, but not at the high speeds associated with 5G. More recently, they have started building out new high-band 5G networks, but these are largely confined to cities or specific venues within cities. You can get a broad overview by using  \u003ca href='https://www.speedtest.net/ookla-5g-map' class='link'\u003eOokla’s 5G map\u003c/a\u003e .\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eVerizon offers low-band 5G across the country, labeled as 5G Nationwide on its  \u003ca href='https://www.verizon.com/coverage-map/' class='link'\u003ecoverage map\u003c/a\u003e .

Low-band, which generally operates below 1 GHz, can reach speeds of 250 Mbps. The trade-off for low-band’s comparatively slower speeds is a broad reach, which means carriers can leave more distance between towers using this kind of equipment.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnalysts call the mid-band of the 5G spectrum the sweet spot, as it has a broad geographic reach and is faster than low-band. Mid-band operates between 1 and 6 GHz and can achieve speeds up to 1 Gbps.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut to reach the top speeds associated with 5G, carriers need millimeter-wave (or mmWave) technology, which takes advantage of the high end of the wireless spectrum, operating at 20 GHz and up. mmWave can enable multi-gig speeds, but millimeter-wave signals are less reliable over long distances and easily disrupted by obstacles like trees, people, and even rain. To make it practical for mobile use, carriers must deploy huge numbers of small access points in cities, instead of relying on a few big cell towers as they do today.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFiguring out  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/where-is-5g-available/' class='link'\u003ewhether 5G is available for you\u003c/a\u003e , and in what form, requires a bit of detective work, but you will also need a device capable of handling a 5G signal.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e5G Smartphones\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnyone wishing to take advantage of these new 5G networks needs a capable device.

Since smartphones connected to 4G LTE can already stream high-quality video, you may be wondering what 5G brings to the table for regular folks. Aside from faster download speeds, lower latency benefits multiplayer and cloud gaming by boosting responsiveness. And 5G\u0026#39;s higher capacity for multiple devices to be connected without issue also helps to keep us all online when we are part of a crowd, whether it’s a packed concert or a football game.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe stability and speed of 5G also promise improvements for driverless cars, remote-piloting drones, and anywhere else where response time is crucial.

The third generation gave digital networks a bandwidth boost and ushered in the smartphone revolution.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e(The wireless spectrum refers to the entire range of radio wave frequencies, from the lowest frequencies to the highest. The US Federal Communications Commission, or FCC, regulates who can use which ranges, or “bands,” of frequencies and for what purposes, to prevent users from interfering with each other’s signals. Mobile networks have traditionally relied mostly on low- and mid-band frequencies that can easily cover large distances and travel through walls.

At the time, Finnish company Nokia was still the world’s largest handset manufacturer, thanks in large part to Europe’s leadership in the deployment and adoption of 2G. Meanwhile, Japan was well ahead of the US in both 3G coverage and mobile internet use.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut not long after the first 3G-capable iPhones began sliding into pockets in July 2008, the US app economy started in earnest.  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/tag/apple/' class='link'\u003eApple\u003c/a\u003e  had just launched the App Store that month, and the first phones using Google\u0026#39;s  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/tag/android/' class='link'\u003eAndroid\u003c/a\u003e  operating system started shipping in the US a few months later.

Google introduced what it calls “AI Mode” to its search page—when you do a search, you\u0026#39;ll be able to get answers from a powerful chatbot. Google already has AI Overviews at the top of search results, so people don’t have to click on links as much. It makes me wonder if your company is stepping into a new paradigm where Google fulfills its mission of organizing and accessing the world’s information not through traditional search, but in a chat with generative AI. If Gemini can satisfy your questions, why search at all?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026#39;s two clear use cases. When you want to get information really quickly and efficiently and just get some facts right, and then maybe check some sources, you use AI-powered search, as you\u0026#39;re seeing with AI Overviews. If you want to do slightly deeper searches, then AI Mode is going to be great for that.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eBut we’ve been talking about how our interface with technology will be a continuous dialog with an AI assistant.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSteven, I don\u0026#39;t know if you have an assistant.

To achieve this, we trained ChatGPT’s predecessor, GPT-2, on examples of popular conspiracy theories and then asked it to generate fake news for us. It gave us thousands of misleading but plausible-sounding news stories.

With the assistance of AI, the process of generating misleading news headlines can be automated and weaponized with minimal human intervention. For example, micro-targeting—the practice of targeting people with messages based on digital trace data, such as their Facebook likes—was already a concern in past elections, despite its main obstacle being the need to generate hundreds of variants of the same message to see what works on a given group of people. What was once labor-intensive and expensive is now cheap and readily available with no barrier to entry. AI has effectively democratized the creation of disinformation: Anyone with access to a chatbot can now seed the model on a particular topic, whether it’s immigration, gun control, climate change, or LGBTQ+ issues, and  \u003ca href='https://www.newsguardtech.com/misinformation-monitor/march-2023/' class='link'\u003egenerate\u003c/a\u003e  dozens of highly convincing fake news stories in minutes.

The most successful vehicle went just seven miles. Most crashed, flipped, or rolled over within sight of the starting gate.

First built in 1961, it could navigate around obstacles using cameras and an early version of artificial intelligence by the early 70s. One problem: It needed 10 to 15 minutes to plan every one-meter move.\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003chr class='my-4 border-t border-gray-300'\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe real job is to endlessly improve the software that interprets that sensor data and uses it to reason about how to move through the world. The key tool for doing that perception work—seeing the difference between a stray shopping cart and a person using a wheelchair, for example—is machine learning, which requires not just serious artificial intelligence chops but also gobs upon gobs of real-world examples to train the system.

In March 2018, a self-driving Uber Volvo XC90 operating in autonomous mode struck and killed a woman named Elaine Herzberg in Tempe, Arizona.

Cadillac Super Cruise, Nissan ProPilot Assist, Ford BlueCruise and Tesla Autopilot all keep a car in its lane and a safe distance from other cars, allowing the people behind the wheel to take their hands off it. In 2018, Tesla debuted a feature called  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/tesla-navigate-on-autopilot/' class='link'\u003eNavigate on Autopilot\u003c/a\u003e , which gives its cars (including those already on the road, thanks to an over-the-air software update) the ability to change lanes to get around slower drivers or to leave the highway when it reaches its exit. Yet the human driver is required to keep paying attention to the road and remain ready to take control if needed. That\u0026#39;s because these systems are not especially capable: They can\u0026#39;t see things like traffic lights or stopped firetrucks.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe problem is that humans are not especially well suited for serving as backups.

At least nine Tesla drivers in the US have died using the system (, and a federal safety board has criticized Tesla for making a system that\u0026#39;s too easy to abuse.

To take a ride, you’ll likely have to use predetermined pickup and dropoff points, so your car can always pull over safely and legally. Meanwhile, the people making these cars will be tackling knotty, practical questions. They’ll be figuring out how much to charge so they can recoup the R\u0026amp;D costs, but not so much to dissuade potential riders. They’ll wrangle with regulators and insurance companies, and what to do in the inevitable event of a crash that brings in the lawyers and legislators and safety advocates. And then, they’ll have to figure out how to expand—which is when the real competition begins.  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/ford-miami-self-driving-cars/' class='link'\u003eFord\u003c/a\u003e  and Waymo and GM and Aurora are all starting their services in different cities—and their trucks  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/self-driving-trucks-ready-business-texas/' class='link'\u003eon different highways in the Southeast\u003c/a\u003e —but now they\u0026#39;re fighting for turf.

He’d spent most of the drive listening to Phil Collins, the Brazilian singer Zeca Baleiro, or whatever else the driver—let\u0026#39;s call him José, though that’s not his real name—put on the truck’s sound system. Akasha loved watching the sandy hills and towns roll by and stopping to eat at roadside restaurants. He approached all travel with a kind of childlike glee, but this trip in April of 2021 had a special purpose: Akasha believed José was taking him to a farm where he grew a tree called jurema preta, whose inner root bark is known for its high concentrations of N,N-Dimethyltryptamine, or DMT.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eDMT is a powerful  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/tag/psychedelic/' class='link'\u003epsychedelic\u003c/a\u003e  compound, capable of inducing brief, mind-blowing trips to otherwise inaccessible states of consciousness, or even, some of its users believe, other planes of reality. For Akasha, the substance was both his holy sacrament and his flagship product. He had spent half a decade setting up secret labs across the western US to turn imported jurema tree bark (which is legal) into DMT (which is not). Under his secret online handle, Shimshai, he’d sold tens of millions of doses to customers on the dark web in packaging emblazoned with his logo: a human with their eyes closed in bliss and a swirl of rainbow colors flowing out of their open cranium.

You may hear things that aren’t there or be filled with inexplicable euphoria or fear.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt the next level, this geometry folds out into three-dimensional space, and you might find yourself transported to the moon, a castle, a beach, inside a pyramid, or into a pulsating Russian bathhouse roughly the size of a womb, to name a few examples. You may “be” in this place and in your physical location at the same time, or inhabit this new destination so fully that you leave your body behind altogether.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn this other place—which many DMT users describe as another dimension—you’re likely to encounter “entities.” Elves, insectoids, reptilians, aliens, gods, and clowns are all common. One DMT test subject reported being attended to by a hyperintelligent 3-foot-tall Gumby.

He’d go out with his friends, talk, listen to music, and watch them get drunk. Often he was the only one tripping. He loved the depth—the sense of telepathy, even—that LSD brought to his otherwise mundane teen social life. “All that square, normal stuff, I would do that on acid,” he says. “And I did that just my whole damn childhood.” He kept a small, blank business card and drew a mark on it every time he tripped. By the time he lost the card, he says, it was full on both sides.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf not for acid, Clements would have had a typical Texas upbringing. He loved BMX biking and going to church. He was named after his father, Joseph Carmichael Clements, who had been an engineer at Texas Instruments and was a Catholic. His mother, who worked in the oil and gas industry, was a Baptist. They divorced when he was 6. He went to Sunday services at both churches and joined Methodist and Lutheran youth groups, too. He thought, from his limited view of the world, that he was exploring the full multiplicity of religious experience.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAround 10th grade, Clements stopped caring about school. He was also diagnosed with ADHD before anyone else he knew. When he got in trouble for disrupting class or ignoring his homework assignments, his father would unfailingly defend him, often blaming his disorder. Eventually, Clements remembers, the school’s teachers and administrators were so scared of his father’s interventions that he felt almost immune from consequences—a sense of invincibility that would stay with him, to some degree, for the rest of his life.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eIndeed, it stuck with Clements even as the years that followed became far more difficult. In his late teens, he says, he began to realize that his father had sexually abused him when he was younger. The memories had always been there, he says, but he had never allowed himself to confront the resentment he felt. He broke ties with his dad, choosing to live with his mother instead, and wouldn’t speak with his father again until the elder Joseph Clements was dying of liver failure decades later.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter high school, he found a job in a restaurant and got married to a woman working as a waitress there, and they had a son. Soon, he says, he discovered that his wife was addicted to opioids and was selling their belongings to pay for her habit. They split up.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA natural salesman with “the gift of gab,” as his mother puts it, Clements found work selling vacuum cleaners door-to-door, building websites, and making deals for billboard advertising in malls.

Their son, 6 years old at the time, was the one who found her body.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eClements moved on and straightened out his life. His son, who had been living with relatives until he was out of prison, moved back in with him. He remarried, had a daughter, and stopped using drugs other than marijuana, which he and his second wife were careful to budget for. He built a successful career running marketing for multiple local businesses, or in some cases consulting for entrepreneurs. He preached Robert Kiyosaki’s  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eRich Dad, Poor Dad\u003c/em\u003e  wealth gospel, which involves creating businesses that run themselves to attain financial independence.

So he picked a new one, inspired by the Akashic records, a supposed ethereal compendium of all life experiences, past and present, that clairvoyants in 19th-century Europe said they could tap into.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt was also around this time that Akasha Song discovered DMT. A friend from the festival scene gave him a small capsule of what he called “dreams.” Akasha looked up the drug online and read that a single dose was equivalent to 300 hits of acid—an exaggeration, but one that got his attention.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSitting on the floor of his home in Houston one evening, Akasha placed a pinch of the pale yellow crystals, which gave off a kind of perfumed new-shoe smell, onto the ash left behind in his weed pipe. He lit it and took his first hit. Akasha’s vision dissolved into “platonic shapes,” as he puts it, the geometric waiting room that initially beckons to DMT users. That was the extent of his first trip. As alien as DMT’s effects were, he says he felt like he was entering a comfortable, natural mental state, exactly where he was supposed to be. “I just remember falling in love immediately,” he says.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOver the next months, Akasha smoked DMT dozens of times. Describing the details of those escalating trips, for Akasha, is difficult. As its nickname suggests, DMT’s effects are a bit like a dream: As vivid as its reality feels in the moment, for many users its sensations fade upon returning to the material world. But he retains a strong memory of one DMT journey in particular, the one he considers the pinnacle of all his psychedelic travels.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat one climactic trip, Akasha says, began with a feeling that he had fallen and hit his head. When he came to, he was lying on his back in an endless void and seven humanoids made of light were gathered around him. He realized, as he looked up at them, that they were somehow everyone he had ever known.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of them lifted him into a sitting position and gestured out at the void, which Akasha now saw was filled with infinite other groups of light-entities encircling infinite other people, each of them either waking or falling asleep. The differences in their states of awareness created a sine wave that Akasha could feel stretching out trillions of miles. The exclamations of those waking up combined into a resonant “music of epiphany,” as Akasha heard it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt that point, Akasha says, he began to understand that his physical life on Earth was a dream and that it was fading. He felt a pang of sadness that he would soon forget his mother, his children, and everyone he had ever loved. The entities seemed to sense his wish to keep dreaming. They laid him back down and, as the trip subsided, he returned to his body.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor days afterward, Akasha was reluctant to speak to anyone, still convinced that the people around him were characters being performed by the entities he had met—that he’d seen the reality underlying human experience and his entire waking life was a dream. On some level, he says, he has never stopped believing it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAkasha had heard\u003c/span\u003e  that it was possible—relatively easy, even—to make DMT, a notion that struck him as almost miraculous. A friend told him that a woman they knew who sold tie-dyed T-shirts at music festivals was familiar with the process. When Akasha asked her, she invited him to her house on the outskirts of Houston the next day. The moment he arrived, she sat him down on her living-room couch, handed him a pipe, and told him to smoke a dose—perhaps to make sure he wasn’t a cop. As he returned to reality, he saw that she had already set out the precursor ingredients of DMT in front of him: lye, the solvent naphtha, and powdered jurema bark.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure class='AssetEmbedWrapper-eVDQiB byBkf asset-embed'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cpicture class='ResponsiveImagePicture-cWuUZO dUOtEa AssetEmbedResponsiveAsset-cXBNxi lqMXz asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image'\u003e\u003cimg src='https://media.wired.com/photos/682c90e62d3f7e27934d4827/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/mason-jar.jpg' alt='Image may contain Jar Cup and Person'\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cp\u003eA mason jar filled with the precursors for DMT that Akasha Song was making in a tent at a music festival.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003eCourtesy of Akasha Song\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eShe walked Akasha through the process of DMT extraction, which he carefully wrote down in his journal: Mix lye with hot water in a mason jar. Add the bark powder, which turns into DMT-laden sludge. Pour in the naphtha and stir. When a yellow-tinged solution separates from the jurema sludge below, draw it off with a turkey baster, squirt it into a baking pan, then put it in the freezer. The crystals that form at the bottom, ready to smoke as soon as the last solvent evaporates, will be DMT.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAkasha’s tutor gifted him a kilo of bark to get him started. He and a friend immediately drove to Ace Hardware, bought naphtha and lye, and followed the process Akasha had just been taught. They smoked the results the next day, reveling in the magic of DIY psychedelic alchemy. Then they drove around town, selling their DMT to friends, instantly making back the money they’d spent at the hardware store as well as a small profit. “It was the most amazing thing,” says Akasha. “I had figured out how to make my most valued possession in the world.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBy December of 2013, Akasha had followed through on his plan to sell everything he owned and move to Colorado. He couch surfed for a while, briefly joined a cult on a ranch, then moved in with a group that lived in a geodesic dome in the mountains. His son was with him at times or else lived with Akasha’s mother. Throughout, Akasha made DMT in mason jars and sold it to meditation circles and at music festivals, using whatever freezer was at hand to crystallize his solutions and sourcing bark from a website in the Netherlands that his DMT tutor had told him about. (The bark itself wasn’t illegal to buy or ship, he learned, because it can be used in non-psychedelic products like cosmetics.) No one in Akasha’s circles ever referred to DMT as a “drug.” It was “medicine”—and he was the medicine man. At times, Akasha’s new vocation could also make him tens of thousands of dollars in a week.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn 2015, Akasha moved in with a group of friends in a house beside a reservoir in Nederland, a small town half an hour’s drive from Boulder through a winding mountain pass. He acquired a ring-tailed lemur as a “service animal.” The little black and white primate, whom Akasha named Oliver, would swing through the rafters of the house, play with Akasha and his friends in the snow-covered aspen trees in their front yard, or sit on his shoulder when he went into town or to parties in Boulder, boosting Akasha’s local celebrity.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e“He was this big, shiny person with a lot of energy,” says one friend who asked me to call him Coinflip, because he’d decided based on a coin flip to partner with Akasha and sell DMT at music festivals. “He was just very inspired, with his big-ass eyes wide open.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAkasha, like his customers, strongly believed in the mind-opening value of DMT. He also understood on some level that he was a drug dealer and that continuing this new career entailed serious legal risk. A conviction for DMT possession or sale in the US carries years in prison for the amounts he was extracting, as much as decades for higher weights. But would cops, or even the feds, actually know what this sand-colored substance was if they saw it? Would they actually care about his seemingly benign hallucinogen? Within Akasha’s community, there was a mantra that he heard again and again: “The medicine is protecting you.” Higher powers, he came to feel, would safeguard him in his spiritual mission. That same sense of invincibility he’d felt since childhood, despite all evidence to the contrary, now echoed in his mind—and pushed him to scale his ambitions ever larger.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSelling DMT at\u003c/span\u003e  music festivals provided a decent living, but it was kind of a drag. Most people still didn’t know what this three-letter substance was, so Akasha would often have to enter vacuum-cleaner salesman mode to make a deal: He’d offer a prospective customer a sample, they’d smoke it in front of him, and he’d wait 15 or 20 minutes for them to return from their trip and become conscious enough to actually buy a gram for $100.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBy 2015, Akasha had heard about a better venue for drug sales: the dark web. He checked out a site called  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/alphabay-series-part-1-the-shadow/' class='link'\u003eAlphaBay\u003c/a\u003e , which had become one of the top markets, and found that there didn’t seem to be much competition to sell DMT. With very little thought, he opened a vendor account for himself with the handle “Shimshai,” the name of an ayahuascarian he’d met in Costa Rica. He initially listed a few different quantities for sale on the market, just to see if anyone would bite. The next day, he was surprised to see he had made three sales, despite having no reviews or reputation of any kind as an online vendor. He scrambled to find mylar bags, bubble wrap, envelopes, and postage, then shipped off his product using a fake return address. The next day he had six orders.

Akasha bought four 35-gallon plastic barrels and put them in the garage of the shared house in Nederland. Around each one, he affixed an electric drum heater—a device that fits around a barrel like a corset. To mix his ingredients, he used an electric drill with a paint stirrer attachment. He’d pour the yellowish top solution into 5-gallon buckets and put them in a freezer he’d bought at Walmart. In about 10 days, he could produce more than a kilogram of DMT—tens of thousands of doses—which he stored in a Tupperware container.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eProducing DMT as a cottage industry had its complications. Akasha’s process produced gallons of waste—used solvent and highly alkaline, lye-infused bark sludge. At times he’d return the naphtha to the paint shop or hardware store where he’d bought it, but other times he’d dispose of it at a sewage plant. The sludge he’d dump in the woods, trying not to think about it too much. “Like a vegan who does cocaine,” Akasha says, “I just didn’t check in with myself about it.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eAkasha knew that his money, too, was toxic. He had read about dark-web moguls whose crypto profits had been  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/2015/01/prosecutors-trace-13-4-million-bitcoins-silk-road-ulbrichts-laptop/' class='link'\u003etraced back to them\u003c/a\u003e  on the bitcoin blockchain. So Akasha created a convoluted laundering setup designed to get around US laws requiring crypto exchanges to know the identities of their customers. He had a Canadian friend sign up on his behalf for an exchange that didn’t require personal information from non-US citizens. Plenty of other friends were interested in getting into crypto, too, and Akasha would offer to sell them his coins for cash. “They had no idea they were buying tens of thousands of dollars of bitcoin that came straight from the darknet,” Akasha says.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBy this time, Akasha had found a contact willing to sell him jurema bark in bulk. But when he asked for a thousand pounds of it, his source suddenly tried to raise the price. So Akasha performed a reverse image search on a product shot of the powdered bark that his source had sent him. He immediately found the website of a seller in Mexico that the friend had been buying from. Soon Akasha had cut out the middleman and was having the shipments sent to friends under fake names.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs online orders climbed toward 100 a day, Akasha turned a guest bedroom of his house into a shipping-and-receiving hub and started hiring his housemates to do the endless work of preparing packages, measuring out DMT, sealing it, bagging it, and putting it in the mail. Postage became a serious headache: Akasha was afraid that a single person buying too many priority stamps from a single post office would raise suspicions. So he paid a rotating crew of housemates to make a circuit of local towns, buying stamps from each one and dropping off a few packages at different mailboxes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSome dark-web drug vendors selling more recognizable wares would triple-vacuum-seal their products to conceal their smell or hide them in disguised packaging, like putting a bag of psychedelic mushrooms into a box of beef stroganoff Hamburger Helper so that it looked like an ingredient. Shimshai didn’t bother with any of that: Given DMT’s relative obscurity, he figured bubble wrap and a mailer envelope was enough to avoid law enforcement’s attention. Inside those layers, Akasha would put his product in a mylar bag marked with the rainbow-mind logo he designed himself.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePositive reviews flowed in, bolstering Shimshai’s reputation. “Out of the park,” one customer would later write. “Always the best, don’t look elsewhere, A++ in every category !” “Perfect transaction, thanks Shimshai!” “Literally sent by the gods.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBy now Akasha had recruited his entire household to keep up with the grind. But ultimately he would trust only one associate to share in managing the online Shimshai persona: his old DMT-selling festival partner Coinflip. As the business boomed, Akasha and Coinflip would eventually do the daily work together of copying sales from the dark web into spreadsheets, responding to customers’ questions, and resolving their complaints—though it was still always Akasha who controlled the keys to the  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/tag/bitcoin/' class='link'\u003ebitcoin\u003c/a\u003e  funds flowing into the Shimshai wallet and paid everyone else, including Coinflip.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs the months went by and Shimshai’s profile grew on the dark web, so too did the secrecy of that name in Akasha’s everyday life. “Even my closest friends didn’t know it,” Akasha says.

He told Akasha he’d have let him in for free—that what Akasha was doing “up in the mountains” was “changing the world for the better.” Akasha immediately left the venue, went home, and started making plans to leave Colorado. This was not the aura of local celebrity he was looking for.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOver the next few days, he told his housemates they were done. He packed his DMT-making equipment into a trailer, hitched it to his Land Rover, and drove to Austin. His son, now a young teenager, came with him. (His lemur, Oliver, did not: As Akasha tells it, a small child had approached the prosimian in a parking lot and got a paw to the face. The  \u003ca href='https://www.dailycamera.com/2016/07/20/illegal-pet-lemur-bites-2-year-old-in-nederland/' class='link'\u003elocal news\u003c/a\u003e  reported it instead as a bite. Oliver was taken by the local police and ended up at a refuge in Florida.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFrom Craigslist, Akasha rented a huge, three-story house on South Austin’s Convict Hill with giant oak trees in the back yard, a view of the city from his bedroom’s balcony, the sun streaming into its windows from three directions, and gallery lighting for his growing art collection. He spent another $50,000 refurbishing his Land Rover. Akasha Song, once a homeless hippie, had come up in the world. Or as he puts it, “I went bougie as hell.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Austin house had a two-car garage with plenty of space for Akasha’s DMT setup. Shimshai was now receiving as many as 200 orders a day, often adding up to $15,000 in daily sales, more money than Akasha had seen before in his life. (The podcaster Joe Rogan would also singlehandedly spike Shimshai’s sales by the hundreds every time he mentioned DMT on his show.) But Akasha was now working alone. By the time he had production in his garage going again, he had a backlog of more than a thousand orders. He was working 12-hour days to stir, decant, freeze, scrape, buy stamps, package, ship, and manage his online profile. “I was running and gunning,” Akasha says. “I could not make enough.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAkasha began hiring friends from the local music scene to take on the work. As soon as anyone heard what he did, he says, they wanted in. “They’d feel honored,” Akasha says. “They had never even seen that much DMT, and they were just so captivated by the idea of it.” But he rarely kept employees long. As soon as he could see that someone was doing the math of how much money he was making, he would unceremoniously let them go.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlmost without noticing, Akasha had let go of his “medicine man” role and its spiritual motivations. “All of a sudden I could have everything that I wanted, whenever I wanted, wherever I wanted,” he says. But Shimshai’s reviews kept calling his product life-changing. Friends still told him he was “doing God’s work.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen, in early July of 2017, Akasha found that AlphaBay was mysteriously offline for more than a week. The Wall Street Journal soon  \u003ca href='https://www.wsj.com/articles/illegal-goods-website-alphabay-shut-following-law-enforcement-action-1499968444' class='link'\u003ebroke the news\u003c/a\u003e  that the site had been taken down by an international law enforcement operation and that its creator and administrator, a French-Canadian man named Alexandre Cazes, had been  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/alphabay-series-part-5-takedown/' class='link'\u003efound dead in a Bangkok jail cell\u003c/a\u003e . Akasha saw his business evaporate before his eyes—including $32,000 he had stored in his AlphaBay account—just as he was growing accustomed to the wealth it was creating. “I’m not a hippie anymore,” he thought. “I’m used to this lifestyle. I need money.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor a moment, he panicked. Then his fear subsided, and he got to work launching Shimshai accounts on all of the remaining dark-web markets, sites with names like Hansa, Wall Street Market, and Dream Market. AlphaBay’s refugee customers, too, began to flow to these new drug-buying havens, and Akasha found that his orders crept up again in the days that followed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBy the middle of July, Hansa too was down: It had been the target of an  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/alphabay-series-part-6-endgame/' class='link'\u003eoperation by Dutch law enforcement\u003c/a\u003e . By all appearances, though, Akasha’s luck had held, and he escaped the dragnet. Through the dark-web tumult, demand for DMT never waned.

So he and his son began scrolling around Google Earth for a new home, and settled on Lake Tahoe.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThey rented a house on the north shore of the lake with a backyard patio surrounded by redwood trees stretching into Tahoe National Forest. The landlord let Akasha pay the rent in bitcoin. This time he brought Coinflip and another friend with him to live and work in the house from the start. They set up DMT production in the garage at more than twice the scale of the lab in Colorado, ultimately expanding to 10 of the same 35-gallon barrels. Two competent lieutenants were now taking much of the work off Akasha’s hands, and he could settle into a lifestyle befitting the crypto millions rolling in.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAkasha and his son spent their days hiking, rock climbing, slacklining, and water-skiing in the ultra-clear lake, riding his new $150,000 G-Wagon to any of three ski resorts within a 20-minute drive, or partying with the locals—who all seemed to be rich, retired, and not very interested in how anyone had made their money.

The woman was named Joules—“like the energy unit”—and she invited Akasha to a communal dinner she was serving on the beach. He learned that she lived with a group of hippies in the woods, grew her own food, hunted and killed wild pigs and goats with snare traps and rocks, and mostly hadn’t worn clothes for the last year. From then on, Akasha’s new long-term goal was to move to Hawaii.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDuring this new jet-set phase, Akasha says, he was at one point stopped by Customs and Border Protection agents in the San Francisco airport on his way home from the Philippines. They confiscated his electronics without explanation. Akasha was terrified that his charmed life was over. But he had enabled full-disk encryption on his laptop, and his phone offered it by default. The agents let him go, and he never got any hint that they had found anything incriminating on his devices. His sense of invincibility intact, he and his friends got back to work.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAkasha now began to imagine a future in which he could remove himself entirely from the production and sale of DMT and run his operation from afar like a true kingpin. Tahoe was lovely, but inconspicuously obtaining large volumes of naphtha and priority stamps was tough so far from a city. So he started periodically returning to Colorado to build the perfect DMT lab that would allow him to enact his exit strategy and realize his new dream of living in Hawaii.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe started renting a house in Jamestown, just northwest of Boulder, with an enormous garage fitted with more electric power, water, and drainage than he’d ever found before—he assumed it was from a previous cannabis-growing operation. At a festival in Idaho a few years earlier, Akasha had met a chemist who recrystallized minerals and made Eastern medicine tinctures in his own lab. Now Akasha paid him a five-figure fee for advice on his DMT operation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhy, the chemist immediately asked, was Akasha siphoning off solvent and throwing it away when he could simply use a distiller to vaporize the naphtha and recondense it in another vat, ready to use again? Akasha’s days of hunting for hundreds of gallons of solvent and then searching again for places to dump it were over. He bought an industrial-grade distiller with a glass window on the condenser and delighted in watching the clean naphtha rain down inside it, ready to use again.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat distillation process would leave behind a cake of DMT at the bottom of the distiller with only a small residue of solvent. The chemist introduced Akasha to a method for shortcutting hours of further drying with a piece of lab equipment called a Büchner funnel—a kind of tapered cup with a micron filter at the bottom over a glass flask. With some suction applied to a side hole in the flask, Akasha could pull most of the remaining solvent out through the filter, leaving the crystals behind.

Around the same time, a friend of Akasha’s with a marijuana growing business asked if he could buy in to the DMT operation. Akasha worked out a deal in which this new partner would fully take over production and sales, and they would move the entire lab into a barn the partner owned on a 40-acre ranch in Evergreen, Colorado. Akasha believed he had fulfilled the  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eRich Dad, Poor Dad\u003c/em\u003e  ideal: He could now fully extract himself from the daily grind of his own businesses while still pulling in profits. It was time to move to Hawaii.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAkasha and Coinflip rented a house on a bluff in Maui, three doors down from the home of the actor Owen Wilson. Akasha and his son would swim with dolphins and sea turtles and catch lobster in the warm water just beyond their front yard. Looking for a clean source of income, they had the idea of starting a motorcycle rental company. They never got it off the ground but nonetheless filled the driveway with seven motorcycles, along with Akasha’s G-Wagon, shipped from the mainland. Akasha himself bought a gleaming white Harley-Davidson Road King.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile Coinflip handled the Shimshai account, Akasha did little other than collect bitcoin and pay everyone their share. For once, there was no DMT production at this new house, so Akasha felt free for the first time to host massive parties, inviting the entire neighborhood over for taco Tuesdays and spending tens of thousands of dollars on sound systems and DJ equipment. He felt he had finally obtained the life he wanted: the money and the total freedom of a hands-off psychedelics kingpin in paradise.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen one afternoon Akasha saw that his phone had six missed calls from his partner back in Colorado, the one now running his DMT production.

Then came a text message with a link to what appeared to be a local news story.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAkasha tapped the link and found a  \u003ca href='https://www.cbsnews.com/colorado/news/flames-s-burning-building-evergreen/' class='link'\u003elive video of a huge barn fire in Evergreen\u003c/a\u003e .

When Akasha was running his own lab, he’d cover his mixing barrels with lids that had a hole in the center, just big enough to accommodate the stirring end of a drill, but not the drill itself. In their postmortem of the catastrophe, Akasha and Coinflip determined that their partner in Evergreen had instead created a new setup with plastic tarps cinched down over the mixing vats—and the automated stirring drills inside. When those drills had activated on the day of the blast, one of their motors had created a spark.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe lab tech running production at the time had been just a few feet away from the vat that ignited. He saw a 14-foot-tall pillar of flame shoot up, slamming the tarp into the ceiling with a  \u003cem class='italic'\u003ecrack\u003c/em\u003e .

Police searched the house on the same property the next day, but the lab tech had managed to move their stockpile of jurema bark. No one was immediately charged. For months to come, Akasha and Coinflip came to believe that perhaps the cops had hit a dead end. Akasha gave his Evergreen partner $10,000 to get a lawyer, then cut ties with him.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStill, Akasha’s days as a hands-off drug boss in Hawaii were over. He knew he needed to either retire from the business altogether or double down. There was never really any question. He made plans with Coinflip to rebuild Shimshai’s DMT production pipeline from a new lab near Portland, across the Washington border, an area far from Evergreen where they had friends.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor the next months, Coinflip ran the new Washington lab while Akasha continued his dream life on Maui. At one party there, he ran into Joules, the woman he’d met under a waterfall in Kauai a couple of years earlier. She had left behind her hippie community in the jungle—and was now wearing clothes.

She was fascinated by Akasha’s preternatural confidence, his wealth, and his wide-eyed appetite for adventure. “He lives in a way I had never experienced with anyone else,” she says. “He just wanted everything, now. The biggest, the best, the wildest, the craziest.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAround the same time, an old contact had reached out to ask Akasha if he could buy DMT from him wholesale.

Not long after the wholesale DMT operation got started, law enforcement seized a 3-kilo shipment in the mail. Akasha and Coinflip now not only owed their wholesale customer close to $60,000 but had to reckon with the possibility that the feds could tie them to a shipment of serious weight.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor Akasha, it was time for a strategic pause. For Coinflip, it was time to get out. In fact, since the lab explosion, he’d become spooked enough by Akasha’s taste for risk that he decided to walk away entirely. “It was really great, and then it was really not OK anymore,” Coinflip says. “Bad things started happening, the greed took over, and I had to cut him off.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJoules helped Akasha pack up his Washington lab equipment and put it into storage, then move out of his Maui house. He temporarily shut down his Shimshai accounts. For the months to come, Akasha told Joules, they’d voyage across Europe in what he described to her as a grand tour. In fact, he was trying to disappear. They flew to Istanbul, then traveled to Vienna, then Barcelona, crossing borders by land whenever possible to lessen their paper trail. Along the way, they stayed in five-star hotels and ate in Michelin-starred restaurants.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter nearly two months, though, Akasha had gotten no hint that international law enforcement was tracking him. So he decided to get back to work. He and Joules flew to the US, took his lab equipment out of storage, and drove with it in a trailer to Colorado. He reopened his Shimshai accounts, then reconnected with his wholesale customer, apologized for ghosting him, and rebuilt his lab in the basement of a house in the town of Morrison.

He and Joules moved to a house on a 26-acre ranch back in Evergreen, with a creek flowing through it, elk and bears that would wander across the property, and a cavernous garage where he could set up a new lab. Joules helped him with production for a time. When the toxic chemicals got to her, she switched to shipping work. He hired more staff and added another lab in Texas in an attempt to decentralize production and shipping and make his operations harder to track. But he was never again as hands-off as he’d been in Hawaii.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn 2019,  \u003ca href='https://www.vice.com/en/article/dark-web-net-dream-market-closed-theories/' class='link'\u003eDream Market shut down\u003c/a\u003e  and German police  \u003ca href='https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/08/03/the-cold-war-bunker-that-became-home-to-a-dark-web-empire' class='link'\u003eseized the servers of Wall Street Market\u003c/a\u003e , which had been operating out of a Cold War–era bunker near the border with Luxembourg. Now Akasha no longer panicked about market takedowns. Instead, he set up Shimshai accounts on more than a dozen smaller markets across the dark web, a collection of sites that together produced as many sales as ever but were far harder for law enforcement to track.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn early 2020, Akasha heard through friends about more troubling news: His partner with the burned-down barn had been criminally charged. The rumor, at least, was that police had learned Akasha’s name, too—whether from clues at the crime scene or from his partner in Evergreen. Coinflip reached out to Akasha, to whom he had otherwise stopped speaking, and they met at a restaurant. Coinflip warned Akasha to “just stop, bro”—to give up his DMT operation and go legit before the feds caught up with him. But nothing Akasha’s old friend said could persuade Akasha to relinquish his empire. “I was drunk on money,” he says.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen Covid lockdowns hit, Akasha’s wholesale arrangement abruptly ended. Whatever venues the people he called the Family had used to move his DMT had been shut down, they told him. Their sales had dried up. Akasha lost a major source of revenue, but he preferred the dark web’s far higher margins anyway. By this time, DMT powder and DMT vape pens were still Shimshai’s biggest products, but he also sold changa—herbs laced with DMT—LSD, MDMA, and mushrooms.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen in 2021 came another problem, one that threatened Shimshai’s operation at a more fundamental level: His bark source texted Akasha without explanation to say he was out of the business. Then he disappeared.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWithout this key ingredient, Shimshai’s production was paralyzed. Akasha began frantically searching for a new source. At one point, he simply googled “jurema.” The results showed a town in the northeast of Brazil with that very name. A bit more reading confirmed his guess: This was indeed a place where DMT literally grew on trees. He knew no one in Brazil and spoke no Portuguese. On a wild impulse, he bought a plane ticket to Rio De Janeiro.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen Akasha arrived in Brazil, he struck up a conversation with the Russian owner of the hostel he was staying at, asking him who might sell jurema preta.

Akasha asked him to put in an order on one of those vendor pages, then used his account to message the seller and ask to meet.

A collection of federal agents known as Joint Criminal Opioid and Darknet Enforcement, or JCODE, had announced sweeping arrests of  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/operation-disruptor-179-arrested-global-dark-web-takedown/' class='link'\u003edozens of dark-web vendors in 2019 and 2020\u003c/a\u003e  without ever spelling out how their targets were identified. Akasha didn’t sell opioids. But he was haunted by a mental image of these agents in a room somewhere working feverishly to track down people like him.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSomehow, all of this led Akasha to adopt his most brazen business model yet. If he was going to smuggle DMT into the US from a lab in Peru or Brazil, he began to think, why not just become an outright drug smuggler?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe had made connections in Amsterdam and began to query them about buying drugs wholesale there, in person. Soon he and some friends were simply flying back and forth to the Netherlands to buy kilos of ketamine, making around $100,000 with every trip. The first visit happened to coincide with a wine festival, so Akasha came up with the idea of dissolving the ketamine he purchased in water, hiding it in wine bottles, then decanting and dehydrating it once he’d got it across US borders.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe says he and his friends successfully pulled off more than a half dozen of these runs to Europe and back and were never caught.

She and Akasha had an arrangement: He paid her to serve as a shipping point for the bark, which would then be picked up by another person and taken to a sprawling production lab in a garage across the city. But this particular shipment was unexpected. José had sent it as a freebie after Akasha complained about sloppy packaging on previous bark orders and threatened to switch to a new source in Peru.

Puzzles got in his van, a Japanese-import Nissan Homy, and drove over to make the pickup.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen he arrived at the cousin’s house, Puzzles noticed that a black Dodge Caravan was parked on the street nearby with one wheel up on the curb, which struck him as a bit strange. Feeling nervous, he moved quickly to pack the bark boxes into his van and drove off, heading for the lab.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA few minutes later, Puzzles noticed not one but two Chevy Tahoes in the rearview mirror. They seemed to be following him. Spooked, he pulled into the parking lot of a grocery store. His van was immediately surrounded by at least a dozen vehicles, out of which emerged local police and an even more alarming badge: Department of Homeland Security. They cuffed Puzzles, took his phone, drove him to an unmarked building, and left him in a cinder-block room with a two-way mirror.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe entire delivery and pickup, Puzzles and Akasha would later learn, had been a sting. Federal investigators had intercepted the jurema bark boxes on their way from Brazil, delivered them to Akasha’s cousin, and then paid her a visit in which they strongly suggested she cooperate with them to avoid prosecution. All but one of the boxes Puzzles had picked up were in fact full of sand they’d swapped out for the bark. He’d been watched since he left his home.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn that cinder-block room, Puzzles was questioned by a Homeland Security agent. When the agent asked Puzzles if he knew who “Akasha” was, he answered that Akasha was a blonde girl who’d flashed him after a show he played with his band at a music venue a few days prior. As Puzzles told it, Akasha had then texted him to ask that he pick up some boxes for her. He’d agreed, naturally, in the hopes of getting laid.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe agent suggested to him that this story was, in fact, bullshit. He offered Puzzles a chance to cooperate. Puzzles responded that he didn’t know what the agent was talking about. After what felt like an hour, he was released. He ran several miles back to his van in the midst of a rainstorm and drove to a friend’s house.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs Puzzles’ arrest and interrogation unfolded, meanwhile, Akasha had gotten a phone call from his cousin. She asked him why cops had swarmed her home. Akasha, rattled, insisted that the bark he’d shipped to her was legal. It was just what he  \u003cem class='italic'\u003edid\u003c/em\u003e  with it that was illegal. “What the hell you think I’ve been doing for my whole life, the last, like, 10 years?” he told her on the phone. “You know what I do.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn fact, agents were still there, in his cousin’s home, listening in on the call, which she had made at their instruction.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAkasha told his cousin not to talk to the cops—not knowing she already had—and promised to pay for her lawyer. He advised her to delete every communication they had ever had. Then he hurriedly put Shimshai into “vacation mode” across all the dark web markets. “We are closed,” he later wrote on the profile pages. “Hurry and leave before the AI gets you.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSoon after, he got a call from Puzzles, who had ridden his bicycle to a Verizon store to get a new phone and to have the phone carrier remotely wipe the one seized by the feds. Both men were deeply anxious, in damage control mode. But it was just bark, after all, wasn’t it? Not actual DMT. And maybe, they told each other, the agents had bought Puzzles’ story.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThey had not\u003c/span\u003e  bought it. In reality, they had been closing in on Akasha for years.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHomeland Security, court documents would later show, had first learned the name Shimshai in a tip shared with the agency in 2017. The source, who has never been revealed, went as far as linking that secret handle to a PO Box in Nederland, Colorado, which was connected to the address where Akasha, his housemates, and Oliver the ring-tailed lemur had lived.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor the department, an upstart DMT dealer was less of a priority than the dark web’s purveyors of cocaine, fentanyl, and heroin. But after that tip, Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) created an alert for the name Akasha Song. Four years later, in the fall of 2021, when José mistakenly shipped a kilogram of bark from Brazil to a customer in Brooklyn with Akasha’s phone number on it, the alert was triggered—just as it would be again six months later when José sent the shipment to Akasha’s cousin.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThose alerts were enough to persuade Kevin Vassighi, an investigator who had joined HSI’s Denver field office in 2020, to check out Shimshai’s accounts on the dark web. Vassighi, a central-casting federal agent with a square jaw, square shoulders, and a high-and-tight haircut, was surprised by the variety and scale of Shimshai’s psychedelic sales. He noted that the dealer sometimes used the avatar of Rafiki, the monkey from  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eThe Lion King\u003c/em\u003e , and connected that image with local news articles about Akasha’s lemur. Vassighi was particularly disturbed to see Shimshai offering DMT vape pens. Vapes, in Vassighi’s mind, were for teenagers. “That indicated to me that he was selling to a more youthful audience,” Vassighi says. “We’re trying to protect kids.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class='AssetEmbedWrapper-eVDQiB byBkf asset-embed'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cpicture class='ResponsiveImagePicture-cWuUZO dUOtEa AssetEmbedResponsiveAsset-cXBNxi lqMXz asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image'\u003e\u003cimg src='https://media.wired.com/photos/682cb444e7027b7192007fc2/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/dmt-chart.jpg' alt='Image may contain Diagram and UML Diagram'\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cp\u003eA cryptocurrency tracing chart used as evidence to support Akasha Song’s criminal charges.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003eCourtesy of Akasha Song\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cinline-embed\u003e\u003cp\u003eBy the spring of 2022, HSI was tracking the location of Akasha’s phone, following him as he drove his new Tesla around Boulder, and watching his home from a camera on a nearby telephone pole. Agents had dug through Akasha’s trash and found Shimshai’s trademark DMT packaging, the logo of a head with a rainbow pouring out of it. And despite Akasha’s alleged attempts at money laundering, they had traced his cryptocurrency to show what they believed to be transactions indirectly flowing into Akasha’s account on the crypto payment service BitPay from half a dozen dark-web markets.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“He has a crunchy vibe.

So Vassighi and his fellow agents piled their suspect into an SUV, with Vassighi up front.

But he still tried to make conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Hey man,” he asked, thinking of a genuine question that had been in his head since he first entered Akasha’s house. “Where’s the lemur?”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAkasha was denied\u003c/span\u003e  bail. Prosecutors pointed out that he’d traveled to 15 countries in just the last five years and was sure to flee the US if he wasn’t held in custody. They were right. “If they had given me a bond,” Akasha says, “I would have definitely left.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe settled into life behind bars. He says his cellmate, for a time, was a biker gang leader named Havoc who had, on the outside, enjoyed mixing DMT with meth, and so took Akasha under his wing. Others would later pay Akasha as much as $100 an hour for offline lessons in using the dark web and cryptocurrency.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAkasha faced felony charges of conspiracy to possess, manufacture, and distribute an illegal drug—specifically about 300 kilos of a Schedule I controlled substance. That was the total weight of the two shipments of bark intercepted by authorities, which was described in the criminal complaint against Akasha as simply “unprocessed DMT.” Akasha learned that, legal though jurema bark may be, this particular quantity of it had been made illegal by his intent to manufacture it into DMT. If convicted of all the charges, Akasha could spend as much as 40 years in prison.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn his attorney’s advice, Akasha decided to accept a plea agreement. He says prosecutors floated the possibility of a shorter sentence in exchange for information on his customers, partners, suppliers, or staff, but he refused.

The real weight of controlled substance in those 300 kilograms ought to be whatever small amount of actual N,N-Dimethyltryptamine Akasha planned to extract.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Drug Enforcement Administration did its own test to determine what the actual percentage of DMT in Akasha’s jurema bark had been. The answer: less than 1 percent. (Akasha privately scoffed that his labs could have gotten much more than that out of the bark, but he didn’t argue.) Suddenly the weight of illegal drugs at the core of his indictment dropped from around 300 kilos to roughly 3.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEven after that stunning win, Akasha might still have faced decades in prison. But he’d had another incredible stroke of good fortune: The state of Colorado, where Akasha was being tried, had just voted to decriminalize a broad swath of psychedelics, including psilocybin, mescaline—and DMT. For so many years of his career as a drug dealer, he’d been told the medicine was protected by a higher power. Now, with a kind of uncanny timing, it actually was.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBy the day of Akasha’s sentencing in February of 2023, the substance he’d been convicted of manufacturing and selling was no longer a crime to use or own in his home state. Technically, that change didn\u0026#39;t apply to selling and shouldn’t have made any difference to Akasha’s federal case.

At the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, Whirlpool created an exhibit called the “Miracle Kitchen”—a futuristic display meant to show what life in capitalist America was like. It included a dishwasher that cleared the table and a proto-Roomba to sweep the floors. “In America, we like to make life easier for women,” Richard Nixon  \u003ca href='https://flashbak.com/soviet-citizens-see-the-future-photos-from-the-1959-kitchen-debate-381510/' class='link'\u003esaid\u003c/a\u003e  to Nikita Khrushchev, the President of the Soviet Union, in an apparent jab on the showfloor.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMost of the early smart home inventions used automatic controls, making it possible to turn something or off without lifting a finger. But they didn’t connect to anything else, and their functionality was limited. That would begin to change in 1983 when ARPANET, the earliest version of the internet, adopted the internet protocol suite (also known as TCP/IP). The protocol set standards for how digital data should be transmitted, routed, and received.

John Romkey, a software engineer and early internet evangelist, had built one for the 1990 showfloor of Interop, a trade show for computers. Romkey dropped a few slices of bread into the toaster and, using a clunky computer, turned the toaster on. It would still be a decade before anyone used the phrase “internet of things,” but Romkey’s magic little toaster showed what a world of internet-connected things might be like. (Of course, it wasn’t fully automated; a person still had to introduce the bread.)

The first of these, LG’s internet-connected refrigerator, hit the market in 2000. It could take stock of shelf contents, mind expiration dates, and for some reason, came with an MP3 player. It also cost $20,000. As sensors became cheaper, these internet-connected devices became more affordable for more consumers. And the invention of smart plugs, like those made by  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/2017/02/review-belkin-wemo-mini-smart-plug/' class='link'\u003eBelkin\u003c/a\u003e , meant that even ordinary objects could become “smart”—or, at least, you could turn them on and off with your phone.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eAny IoT system today contains a few basic components. First, there’s the  \u003cem class='italic'\u003ething\u003c/em\u003e  outfitted with sensors. These sensors could be anything that collects data, like a camera inside a smart refrigerator or an accelerometer that tracks speed in a smart running shoe. In some cases, sensors are bundled together to gather multiple data points: a Nest thermostat contains a thermometer, but also a motion sensor; it can adjust the temperature of a room when it senses that nobody’s in it. To make sense of this data, the device has some kind of network connectivity (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, cellular, or satellite) and a processor where it can be stored and analyzed. From there, the data can be used to trigger an action—like ordering more milk when the carton in the smart refrigerator runs out, or adjusting the temperature automatically given a set of rules.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eMost people didn’t start building an ecosystem of “smart” devices in their homes until the mass adoption of voice controls. In 2014, Amazon introduced the Echo, a speaker with a helpful voice assistant named Alexa built in. Apple had introduced Siri, its own voice assistant, four years prior—but Siri lived on your phone, while Alexa lived inside the speaker and could control all of the “smart” devices in your house. Positioning a voice assistant as the centerpiece of the smart home had several effects: It demystified the internet of things for consumers, encouraged them to buy more internet-enabled gadgets, and encouraged developers to create more “skills,” or IoT commands, for these voice assistants to learn\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe same year that Amazon debuted Alexa, Apple came out with HomeKit, a system designed to facilitate interactions between Apple-made smart devices, sending data back and forth to create a network. These unifying voices have shifted the landscape away from single-purpose automations and toward a more holistic system of connected things. Tell the Google Assistant “goodnight,” for example, and the command can dim the lights, lock the front door, set the alarm system, and turn on your alarm clock. LG’s SmartThinQ platform connects many home appliances, so you can select a chocolate chip cookie recipe from the screen of your smart fridge and it’ll automatically preheat the oven. Manufacturers bill this as the future, but it’s also a convenient way to sell more IoT devices. If you already have an Amazon Echo, you might as well get some stuff for Alexa to control.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBy 2014, the number of internet-connected devices would surpass the number of people in the world. David Evans, the former chief futurist at Cisco,  \u003ca href='https://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2015/06/internet-of-things-growth-challenges-000098' class='link'\u003eestimated\u003c/a\u003e  in 2015 that “an average 127 new things are connected to the internet” every second.

All of these objects, brought to life like Pinocchio, have made the world easier to control: You can let the delivery man in the front door, or change the temperature inside the house, all with a few taps on a smartphone.

Now that people have their speakers, television sets, refrigerators, alarm clocks, toothbrushes, light bulbs, doorbells, baby monitors, and security cameras connected to the Wi-Fi, nearly every device in the house can be compromised, or rendered useless. Consider the whims of internet connectivity: When your Wi-Fi goes down, so do your devices. Router problems? That means you can’t turn on the heat with your smart thermostat, or unlock your smart door lock. Things that used to be easy become potentially faulty, if not impossible, when they require an Alexa command or a smartphone control rather than a physical button. Many of these devices also run on proprietary software—meaning, if their manufacturer goes bunk, gets sold, or stops issuing software updates, your clever little gadget becomes a useless hunk of plastic.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRisk of bricking aside, connecting things to the internet also leaves those objects, and everything else on your Wi-Fi network, more vulnerable to hackers. Laura DeNardis, in her recent book  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eThe Internet in Everything\u003c/em\u003e , has called this threat to cybersecurity the greatest human rights issue of our time. The risk isn’t just that some prankster breaks into your smart washing machine and upsets the spin cycle, or that your Nest camera gets hijacked with a message to subscribe to PewDiePie’s YouTube channel.

In 2016, malware called Mirai exploited these kinds of vulnerabilities in over 600,000 IoT devices to create a massive distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack. The following year, an  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/krack-wi-fi-wpa2-vulnerability/' class='link'\u003eattack called Krack\u003c/a\u003e  infected nearly every internet-connected device connected to Wi-Fi. The attack was crippling and difficult to defend against, in part because the internet of things runs on so many disparate operating systems. When a phone or a computer gets hit with a virus, software makers are generally quick to issue a patch. But things like routers or internet-connected doorbells don’t usually receive software updates needed to protect against vulnerabilities, and many of them weren’t built with the same kind of security protocols as computers. After the Krack attack,  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/krack-wi-fi-iot-security-broken/' class='link'\u003eone security researcher predicted\u003c/a\u003e  that we would still “find vulnerable devices 20 years from now.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe threat of hacks on internet-connected devices remains a big problem, both for companies and for consumers. In 2014, hackers stole credit card information from 40 million Target customers after breaching the corporate network. How did they get in? A malware email was sent to Target’s HVAC vendor, which had been given remote access to Target’s network. When the vendor clicked the email, hackers had remote access, too. In 2019, Amazon faced a $5 million class action lawsuit from customers who alleged that their internet-connected Ring doorbells had been left open to cyberattacks. Those customers shared stories of hackers who, through their doorbells, harassed them and demanded ransom money. (The company denied blame, claiming instead that it was the customers’ fault for using weak passwords.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eThese security breaches inspired California\u0026#39;s IoT Security Law, the first law of its kind to raise the security standards on IoT device-makers. The law, which applies to any device with the ability to connect to the internet, mandates a series of cybersecurity checks in the product\u0026#39;s development and design. For now, those requirements are fairly simple—better authentication and password management, basically—but it’s an important first step in regulating the security of internet-connected devices. In 2019, Oregon followed California’s lead with its own IoT security law, which mandates that manufacturers build “reasonable security features” into their IoT devices.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen there’s the question of privacy. If cameras and microphones are studded around your home, they are definitely watching and listening to you. Everything in the internet of things collects data—and all that data has value. In a  \u003ca href='https://moniotrlab.ccis.neu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/ren-imc19.pdf' class='link'\u003erecent study\u003c/a\u003e , researchers found that 72 of the 81 IoT devices they surveyed had shared data with a third party unrelated to the original manufacturer. That means the finer details of your personal life—as depicted by your smart toothbrush, your smart TV, or your smart speaker—can be repackaged and sold to someone else. Google and Apple both admitted, in 2019, that the recordings captured by their smart speakers are reviewed by contractors, including awkward and intimate snippets of audio. Amazon has partnerships with over 400 police departments, who use the footage from its Ring doorbell cameras to keep watch on neighborhoods. An ever-expanding internet of things doesn’t just have consequences for personal privacy. It can create a network of computer eyes and ears everywhere we go.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class='AssetEmbedWrapper-eVDQiB byBkf asset-embed'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cpicture class='ResponsiveImagePicture-cWuUZO dUOtEa AssetEmbedResponsiveAsset-cXBNxi lqMXz asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image'\u003e\u003cimg src='https://media.wired.com/photos/5a726e8cd107c842c752925b/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/whatsnext.jpg' alt='What Is the Internet of Things A WIRED Guide'\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch2 class='text-xl font-semibold'\u003eThe Future of the Internet of Things\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne day, the internet of things will become the internet of  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eevery\u003c/em\u003e thing. The objects in our world might sense and react to us individually all the time, so that a smart thermostat automatically adjusts based on your body temperature or the house automatically locks itself when you get into bed. Your clothes might come with connected sensors, too, so that the things around you can respond to your movements in real time. That’s already starting to happen: In 2017, Google announced  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/i-wore-the-jean-jacket-of-the-future/' class='link'\u003eProject Jacquard\u003c/a\u003e , an effort to create the connected wardrobe of the future.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn 2018, there were 23 billion connected devices, according to market data from Statista. By 2025, forecasters believe there will be more than 75 billion. Part of that explosion comes from people getting more comfortable with an always-on, data-collecting device that sits in their living room. But it also comes from product-makers dreaming up new things to connect to the internet. This vision extends far beyond your home, and even your clothes. You’ll also have smart offices, smart buildings, smart cities. Smart hospital rooms will have sensors to ensure that doctors wash their hands, and airborne sensors will help cities predict mudslides and other natural disasters. Autonomous vehicles will connect to the internet and drive along roads studded with sensors, and governments will manage the demands on their energy grids by tracking household energy consumption through the internet of things. The growth of the internet of things could also lead to new kinds of cyberwarfare; imagine a bad actor disabling every smart thermostat in the dead of winter, or hacking into internet-connected pacemakers and insulin pumps. It could create new class systems: those with robot maids, and those without. Or, as Ray Bradbury described in one short story from 1950, all the people might disappear—but the smart homes, preparing meals and sweeping the floors, will live on.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf we’re going to get there—whether we like “there” or not—we’re going to need faster internet.  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/wired-guide-5g/' class='link'\u003eEnter: 5G\u003c/a\u003e . Crazy-fast internet speeds have long been overpromised and undelivered, but these days, you can see real 5G if you squint. In 2020, as the coronavirus pandemic sent daily work and life into cyberspace, the FCC accelerated its timeline for improving existing internet infrastructure. That could have happy consequences for remote work and school, but might also speed up the possibilities for other internet-enabled devices. China, which is much closer to adopting the 5G standard nationwide, has this year begun testing things like 5G-powered robots in hospital wards to protect doctors from contagious diseases, like the novel coronavirus. Even without 5G, the internet of things supported health care this year. Researchers used the GPS in mobile phones to track the spread of the virus, public health workers used sensors to monitor patients under quarantine, and doctors used internet-connected devices, like drones and robots, to deliver drugs and check on patients without risking contact.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe’ll also need to keep all those devices from  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/your-connected-devices-are-screwing-up-astronomy/' class='link'\u003emucking up the airwaves\u003c/a\u003e , and we’ll need to find a better way to secure the data that’s transmitted across those airwaves. Recently, the Swiss cryptography firm Teserakt introduced an idea for a  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/e4-iot-encryption/' class='link'\u003ecryptographic implant for IoT devices\u003c/a\u003e , which would protect the data that streams from these devices. And Darpa—that’s the Department of Defense’s innovation arm—is also working on buffing up the security technology for the military’s various IoT devices. That effort, delightfully named CHARIOT (Cryptography for Hyper-scale Architectures in a Robust Internet Of Things), aims to prototype a number of low-cost cryptography techniques to make internet-enabled devices harder to hack into. Darpa’s inventions aren’t just for the military: Drones, GPS, autonomous vehicles, and the actual worldwide web all came out of the agency’s research projects. So if the agency can crack IoT security well enough for the military, it’s likely to help your humble HomePod, too.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere are also ideas for creating a better standard for IoT devices, and plans to help them get along with each other, regardless of which company makes them or which voice assistant lives inside.

The siblings discussed adopting a dog together.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut there was a darker side to their life: Kevin and Tanya dealt fentanyl and marijuana, often finding customers on Snapchat. Kevin planned to start “carding,” stealing people’s credit card information on the dark web. And he took to amassing weapons.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe guys Bui had arranged to meet in central Denver on that day in July had promised to sell him a gun.

A few weeks earlier, football practice had shut down because of the pandemic. Classes had already been virtual for months. He felt he was “just doing bullshit”: waking up, logging on to Zoom, and returning to bed. The robbery tipped him over the edge. That night, at home in Lakewood, Bui resolved to get even. He pulled up the Find My device feature on his iPad and watched as it pinged his phone. The map zoomed east, past downtown, finally halting at Green Valley Ranch. A pin dropped at 5312 Truckee Street.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe next afternoon, Bui sent a Snapchat message to his friend Gavin Seymour. “I deserved that shit cuz I knew it would happen and still went,” he wrote, according to later court records. “They goin get theirs like I got mine.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBui and Seymour ran track together and lived just a four-minute drive apart. But in many ways they were opposites. Where Bui oozed confidence, Seymour was plagued by insecurity. Where Bui excelled academically, Seymour struggled with multiple learning disabilities. In contrast to Bui’s apparently cookie-cutter-perfect family life, Seymour’s parents split when he was young, and his father was largely absent.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn response to Bui’s message, Seymour wrote: “idk why I would let you go alone I’m sorry for that.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBui wrote back: “I cant even be mad cuz we used to do the same shit to random niggas.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut he  \u003cem class='italic'\u003ewas\u003c/em\u003e  mad. More to the point, he was disgraced, his self-image—as a winner, a champ, top dog—shattered. A week later, Bui searched the Truckee Street address 13 times, including on sites like Zillow that detailed its interior layout. And he persuaded Seymour, who was just about to turn 16, and another friend, 14-year-old Dillon Siebert, to help him exact revenge. In late July, Seymour and Siebert also searched the address multiple times.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBui would later insist they’d planned to simply vandalize the house: hurl rocks at the windows, maybe, or egg the exterior. But sometime in those last hot days of July, things took a darker turn. On August 1, Bui messaged Seymour: “#possiblyruinourfuturesandburnhishousedown.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThree evenings later, Siebert and Bui went to Party City to buy black theater masks, then grabbed dinner at Wendy’s. They met up with Seymour, and at around 1 am on August 5 the three piled into Bui’s Toyota Camry. They stopped at a gas station, where they filled a red fuel canister to the brim. Then they set off for Green Valley Ranch, cruising past downtown and the Broncos stadium and through an industrial area dotted with smokestacks and semitrailers. The drive took at least 30 minutes, long and boring enough for any one of the teens to express doubt, postpone, chicken out. But it seemed none of them did, not even when they got to 5312 Truckee and saw a minivan—a family vehicle—parked out front.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure class='AssetEmbedWrapper-eVDQiB byBkf asset-embed'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cpicture class='ResponsiveImagePicture-cWuUZO dUOtEa AssetEmbedResponsiveAsset-cXBNxi lqMXz asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image'\u003e\u003cimg src='https://media.wired.com/photos/6825c7a9b1d6aac53d8d026b/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/WI070125_FF_iPhoneFire_05_.png' alt='Image may contain Field Grassland Nature Outdoors Grass Plant Architecture Building Shelter Road and Scenery'\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003eGreen Valley Ranch, in the eastern suburbs of Denver, was a new and sparsely populated neighborhood with a confusing road layout and rows of cookie-cutter family homes.

The air tasted like ash. He spotted Ernest Sandoval, his partner on the case. Sandoval, nearly 15 years younger than Baker, had moved to homicide from the nonfatal shootings unit only a few weeks earlier.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe officers on the scene told the pair that there could be as many as five fatalities. They suspected faulty wiring had sparked the blaze. It was terrible, tragic—but at least homicide’s job would be straightforward. “We’ll have some reports to write,” Baker remembers thinking. “We’ll have to probably go to the autopsies.” Then a man with melancholy eyes and a faint soul patch approached him. “I have something you should see,” he said. Noe Reza Jr. lived next door. He took out his phone, which held footage from his security cameras.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe video clips started at 2:26 am. They showed three figures in hoodies and masks stealing through the side yard of 5312 Truckee. One points toward the rear of the house. Then they move out of the camera’s sight. Twelve minutes later, the trio sprint back toward the street. At 2:40, flames erupt from the home’s lower floor. Someone screams. The fire consumes the entire house within two minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Oh, are you kidding me,” Baker thought. Five people had been murdered and their only lead was a few seconds of video that revealed nothing of the criminals’ identity.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat morning, Kevin Bui slept in. Around 10 am, he searched online for news of the fire. There was an abundance. The tragedy had sparked headlines and Twitter threads across the world. The Council on American Islamic Relations issued a statement urging police to consider religious hate as a potential motive. Leaders of Colorado’s African community expressed fear, wondering which of their members might be targeted next. Even Senegal’s president tweeted he’d be watching the case closely.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat’s when the truth began to dawn on Bui. Like many people, he had assumed that Apple’s Find My device software offers exact location tracking. But such programs rely on an unreliable combination of signals from GPS satellites, cell towers, Wi-Fi networks, and other connected devices nearby, and their accuracy can vary from a few feet to hundreds of miles. In the past, this ambiguity has led to threats, holdups, and even SWAT raids at the wrong addresses. (Apple did not respond to a request for comment.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs he read the news that morning, Bui realized that he had made a terrible mistake. These innocent faces didn’t belong to the guys who had robbed him. He’d killed a family.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThat August, Denver’s\u003c/span\u003e  usually crystalline skies were choked with wildfire smoke. Baker and Sandoval barely noticed. They spent their waking hours in DPD’s 1970s-era HQ, with its fluorescent lighting and gumball machines in the lobby.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe pair had begun their investigation with the usual stuff: interviewing the victims’ friends and family, combing through text messages and financial records. The more they dug, the clearer it became that the families of 5312 Truckee lived quiet, pious lives: work, mosque, home.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe detectives returned to video footage. On clips pieced together from nearby Ring cameras, they saw the car the suspects were in taking a series of wrong turns as it entered the neighborhood, and wildly swerving and mounting curbs on the way out. But the videos weren’t clear enough to identify the exact make or model of the dark four-door sedan. The detectives quickly obtained what are known as tower dump warrants, which required the major phone networks to provide the numbers of all cellular devices in the vicinity of 5312 Truckee during the arson. And they slung a series of so-called geofence warrants at Google, asking the company to identify all devices within a defined area just before the fire. (At the time, Google collected and retained location data if someone had an Android device or any Google applications on their cell phone.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe warrants returned thousands of phone numbers, which the detectives dumped on Mark Sonnendecker, an agent at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) who specialized in digital forensics. Sonnendecker, slim and soft-spoken with a face resembling Bill Nye’s, focused on T-Mobile subscribers. He had noticed that a “high percentage” of suspects in previous cases subscribed to the network.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere were 1,471 devices registered to T-Mobile within a mile of the house when it ignited. Using software that visualizes how long it takes a signal to bounce from a cell tower to a phone and back again, Sonnendecker narrowed the list down to the 100 devices nearest to the house. One evening toward the end of August, detectives roamed the area around 5312 Truckee with a cell-phone-tower simulator that captured the IDs of all devices within range. That night, there were 723. Sonnendecker cross-referenced these with the 100 from earlier, eliminating the 67 that showed up on both lists and likely belonged to neighborhood residents who could be ruled out. That left 33 T-Mobile subscribers whose presence in Green Valley Ranch in the early hours of August 5 couldn’t easily be explained.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eInvestigators considered bringing them in for questioning but decided against it; without any evidence to detain them, they feared spooking the arsonists into fleeing the country. Nothing pointed to any obvious suspects. Still, Sonnendecker remained confident that something would pop up to give police the breakthrough they needed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut as summer turned to fall, progress on the case began to falter. Hundreds of Crime Stoppers tips were still pouring in, including some from psychics. Baker and Sandoval crisscrossed the state to interrogate a trio found with drugs, guns, and masks in Gypsum and to interview the Senegalese community in the mountain town of Silverthorne. (For decades, West Africans had found work in the ski hub’s many resorts, hotels, and grocery stores.) They even chased a lead to Iowa. “We got pretty hopeful here and there, but it just kind of fizzled out,” recalls Baker.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe detectives were feeling the pressure. In the wake of nationwide Black Lives Matter protests that summer, a  \u003ca href='https://www.change.org/p/jared-polis-justice-for-the-diol-family' class='link'\u003epetition\u003c/a\u003e  demanding police stop “undervaluing the lives of BIPOC individuals” and prioritize the investigation into the deaths of the Diol family collected nearly 25,000 signatures. Baker and Sandoval were told not to take on any new cases so they could work this one full time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAt a department\u003c/span\u003e  meeting in September, Baker and Sandoval pleaded with colleagues for ideas. Was there anything they hadn’t tried—anything at all? That’s when another detective wondered if the perpetrators had Googled the address before heading there. Perhaps Google had a record of that search?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt was like a door they’d never noticed suddenly flung open. They called Sonnendecker and the senior deputy district attorney, Cathee Hansen. Neither had heard of Google turning over a list of people who had searched for a specific term. In fact, it had been done: in a 2017 fraud investigation in Minnesota, after a series of bombings in Austin in 2018, in a 2019 trafficking case in Wisconsin, and a theft case in North Carolina the following year. Federal investigators also  \u003ca href='https://www.forbes.com/sites/siladityaray/2020/10/08/google-shared-search-data-with-feds-investigating-r-kelly-victim-intimidation-case/' class='link'\u003eused\u003c/a\u003e  a reverse keyword search warrant to investigate an associate of R. Kelly who attempted to intimidate a witness in the musician’s racketeering and sexual exploitation trial. But those records had largely been sealed. So, largely unaware of these precedents, Hansen and Sandoval drafted their warrant from scratch, requesting names, birth dates, and physical addresses for all users who’d searched variations of 5312 Truckee Street in the 15 days before the fire.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eGoogle denied the request. According to court documents, the company uses a staged process when responding to reverse keyword warrants to protect user privacy: First, it provides an anonymized list of matching searches, and if law enforcement concludes that any of those results are relevant, Google will identify the users’ IP addresses if prompted by the warrant to do so. DPD’s warrant had gone too far in asking for protected user information right away, and it took another failed warrant 20 days later and two calls with Google’s outside legal counsel before the detectives came up with language the search giant would accept.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFinally, the day before Thanksgiving 2020, Sonnendecker received a list of 61 devices and associated IP addresses that had searched for the house in the weeks before the fire. Five of those IP addresses were in Colorado, and three of them had searched for the Truckee Street house multiple times, including for details of its interior. “It was like the heavens opened up,” says Baker.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn early December, DPD served another warrant to Google for those five users’ subscriber information, including their names and email addresses. One turned out to be a relative of the Diols; another belonged to a delivery service. But there was one surname they recognized—a name that also appeared on the list of 33 T-Mobile subscribers they’d identified earlier in the investigation as being in the vicinity of the fire. Bui.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe phone was registered to Kevin’s sister Tanya—he may have borrowed it after his was stolen. But a quick scan of the social media accounts of the remaining subscribers on the list yielded three suspects: Kevin Bui, Gavin Seymour, and Dillon Siebert. They were teens, they were friends, and they didn’t live anywhere near Green Valley Ranch. They lived in the Lakewood area, 20 miles away. There was no reason for them to be Googling a residential address so far across town.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“There was a lot of high-fiving,” recalls Sandoval. But it was too soon to fully celebrate. They now had to build a case strong enough to prosecute minors in a high-profile homicide. “We knew this was going to be a big, big, big fight,” Baker says.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn New Year’s Day of 2021, Baker drove by the Bui family’s home and snapped a photo of the 2019 Toyota Camry sitting in the driveway. Another warrant to Google yielded the three teens’ search histories since early July. In the days before the fire, Siebert searched for retailer “Party City.” On Party City’s website, Baker spotted masks similar to those worn by the three perpetrators. The company confirmed that their Lakewood location had sold three such masks hours before the fire. Baker then contacted the shopping complex to get footage from the exterior security cameras that night. He saw that around 6 pm, a 2019 Toyota Camry pulled into the parking lot. “It just snowballed,” says Baker, shaking his head in remembered wonder. “I cannot believe the amount of evidence that we were able to come up with.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure class='AssetEmbedWrapper-eVDQiB byBkf asset-embed'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cpicture class='ResponsiveImagePicture-cWuUZO dUOtEa AssetEmbedResponsiveAsset-cXBNxi lqMXz asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image'\u003e\u003cimg src='https://media.wired.com/photos/6825c821ee17567592aa9aa8/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/WI070125_FF_iPhoneFire_02.png' alt='Image may contain Accessories Buckle Logo Belt Badge Symbol Adult and Person'\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003ePhotography: Jimena Peck\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eFrom the teens’ texts and social media, detectives were able to see that the morning after the arson, with the house on Truckee Street still smoldering, Bui and Seymour embarked on a camping trip. A week later, Bui went golfing. A few months after that, Seymour joined the Bui family on vacation in Cancun, where more smiling photos of the two emerged, this time on beaches and boats. The posts enraged the detectives. “Where’s the remorse?” Baker said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eShortly after 7 am on January 27, police arrested Bui, Seymour, and Siebert. Seymour and Siebert refused to talk, but Bui agreed to an interview and promptly confessed. “He’d had six months of just keeping this inside,” said Baker. “He knew that his time had come.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eFor the next\u003c/span\u003e  18 months, the case dragged through the court system. It took a year for a judge to rule that Siebert, 14 at the time of the crime, would be charged as a juvenile, while 16-year-olds Bui and Seymour would be tried as adults. If convicted, they faced life in prison.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn June 2022, just when it seemed like the prosecution could finally proceed, Seymour’s lawyers dropped a bombshell. They filed a motion to suppress all evidence arising from the reverse keyword search warrant that DPD had served to Google—the key piece of information that had led detectives to Bui and his friends.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNearly two years had passed since the Diols were killed in their own home. Many of the victims’ family and friends still moved through their days fearfully and lay awake nights, reliving the nightmare. Now, the detectives had to tell them that the case might be thrown out altogether, potentially allowing the three teens to walk free.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSeymour’s defense argued that, in asking Google to comb through billions of users’ private search history, investigators had cast an unconstitutional “digital dragnet.” It was, they said, the equivalent of police ransacking every home in America. The Fourth Amendment required police to show probable cause for suspecting an individual  \u003cem class='italic'\u003ebefore\u003c/em\u003e  getting a warrant to search their information. In this case, police had no reason to suspect Seymour before seeing the warrant’s results. But the judge sided with law enforcement. He likened the search to looking for a needle in a haystack: “The fact that the haystack may be big, the fact that the haystack may have a lot of misinformation in it doesn’t mean that a targeted search in that haystack somehow implicates overbreadth,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe teens’ fate looked sealed. Then, in January 2023, Seymour’s lawyers announced that the Colorado Supreme Court had agreed to hear their appeal. It would be the first state supreme court in America to address the constitutionality of a keyword warrant. Though the verdict would apply only in Colorado, it would influence law enforcement’s behavior in other states, and potentially the US Department of Justice’s stance on such warrants too.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBaker and Sandoval’s investigation had now been dragged into a legal process that could reshape Americans’ right to search and learn online without fear of retribution. “Even a single query can reveal deeply private facts about a person, things they might not share with friends, family, or clergy,” wrote Seymour’s legal team. “‘Psychiatrists in Denver;’ ‘abortion providers near me;’ ‘is my husband gay;’ ‘does God exist;’ ‘bankruptcy;’ ‘herpes treatment’ … Search history is a window into what people wonder about—and it is some of the most private data that exists.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Colorado Supreme Court heard arguments for the case in May 2023. Seymour’s attorney argued that reverse keyword searches were alarmingly similar to geofence warrants, which courts across the country had begun to question. (In August 2024, a federal circuit court of appeals—considered the most influential courts in the United States after the Supreme Court—ruled geofence warrants “unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment” for never specifying a particular user.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDenver’s prosecutor, Cathee Hansen—who’d helped detectives craft the warrant in question nearly three years earlier—compared it to querying a bank for suspicious transactions. “You don’t go into each person’s account and scroll through their transaction history to see if it applies to that account,” she said. “You just tap into a database.” Neither search violated any individual’s privacy, she argued.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe judges pushed Hansen on the warrant’s applicability to abortion, outlawed in a growing number of states. “I could see warrants coming in from one of those states to Colorado: Who searched for abortion clinics in Colorado?” said Justice Richard Gabriel. “Under your view, there’d be probable cause for that. That’s a big concern.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter a five-month wait that Sandoval remembers as “gut-wrenching,” the court finally ruled in October 2023. In a majority verdict, four judges decided the reverse keyword search warrant was legal—potentially opening the door to wider use in Colorado and beyond. The judges argued that the narrow search parameters and the performance of the search by a computer rather than a human minimized any invasion of privacy. But they also agreed the warrant lacked individualized probable cause—the police had no reason to suspect Seymour before they accessed his search history—rendering it “constitutionally defective.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBecause of the ruling’s ambiguity, some agencies remain leery. The ATF’s Denver office says it would only consider using a keyword warrant again if the search terms could be sufficiently narrowed, like in this case: to an address that few would have reason to search and a highly delimited time period. The crime would also have to be serious enough to justify the level of scrutiny that would follow, the ATF says.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eNot everyone is so cautious. Baker and Sandoval regularly field calls from police across the country asking for a copy of their warrant. Baker himself is considering using it in another case. And a cottage industry of consultants that, until recently, helped police craft tower-dump warrants now trains them to requisition Google. No systemic data is being collected on how often reverse keyword warrants are being used, but Andrew Crocker, surveillance litigation director of digital rights group the Electronic Frontier Foundation says it’s possible that there have been hundreds of examples to date.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, another case—in which a keyword-search warrant was used to identify a serial rapist—is now before the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. If the warrant is upheld, as it was in Colorado, their use could accelerate nationwide. “Keyword warrants are dangerous tools tailor-made for political repression,” says Crocker. It’s easy to envision Immigrations and Customs Enforcement requesting a list of everyone who searched “immigration lawyer” in a given area, for instance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eBy the summer\u003c/span\u003e  of 2024, all three teens had accepted plea deals: Siebert got 10 years in juvenile detention; Seymour got 40, and Kevin Bui 60, both in adult prison. Bui received the harshest sentence because he’d masterminded the arson. (He was also caught with 92 pills of fentanyl and a couple grams of methamphetamine in his sock while in detention.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo the victims, none of it was enough. Amadou Beye, the husband of Hassan Diol and father of seven-month-old Hawa, addressed Bui directly at his sentencing. “I will never forget or forgive you for what you did to me,” he said. “You took me away from my wife, the most beautiful thing I had. You took me away from my baby that I will never have a chance to see.” A shudder ran through his tall body. Beye had been in Senegal awaiting a visa when his family was killed. His daughter was born in America, and he never got to meet her.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBui remained expressionless throughout the victim impact testimonies, save for a furiously bobbing Adam’s apple. Peach fuzz darkened his now 20-year-old jaw. He wore a green jumpsuit, clear-framed glasses, and white shoes. At the end, he read from a crumpled sheet of yellow ruled paper. “I was an ignorant knucklehead blinded by rage. I’m a failure who threw his life away,” he said. “I have no excuses and nobody to blame but myself.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut when I talked to Bui three months later, he sounded upbeat. “When you go to prison there’s a lifeline,” he told me. Monday through Friday, he took classes on personal growth and emotional intelligence. Aside from that, “I just work out, I chill with some of the guys. We eat together, watch TV, watch sports,” he said. He tried to catch every Denver Broncos and Baltimore Ravens game. Lately, he’d also gotten into  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eSex and the City\u003c/em\u003e .\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNot once did Bui complain about the lack of privacy in prison or his exile from the outside world, both physical and digital. Prisoners had little internet access, which, for someone of his generation, who’d grown up online, must have been hard. Did he know who he was without his iPhone, his Snapchat and Instagram? Who were any of us really, without our online personas, our memes and TikToks and the access to the entirety of human knowledge afforded by our devices? As Seymour’s lawyers had argued, didn’t our deepest, truest selves reside online, in our searches and browsers?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAll Bui would say was that he was in a good place now.

Still, Apple Intelligence–based features and upgrades were plentiful, and while some are powered using the company\u0026#39;s privacy- and security-focused cloud platform known as  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/apple-private-cloud-compute-ai/' class='link'\u003ePrivate Cloud Compute\u003c/a\u003e , many run locally on Apple Intelligence–enabled devices.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eApple’s new Messages screening feature automatically moves texts from phone numbers and accounts you’ve never interacted with before to an “Unknown Sender” folder.

If AI features are going to be widely available and accessible, though, most companies are constrained by attempting to factor in the old, low-end devices that many of their customers are likely using that may not be able to handle local AI. Apple has less need to be inclusive, though, because it produces both hardware and software and has already imposed limitations that Apple Intelligence can only run on recent device models.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere are other limitations to Apple Intelligence, too, and the company offers opt-in integrations with some third-party generative AI services to expand functionality.

Additionally, users can elect to log in to a ChatGPT account, in which case their queries will be subject to OpenAI’s normal policies, or they can use ChatGPT without logging in. In this scenario, Apple says, it does not connect an Apple ID or other identifier to queries and obfuscates users‘ IP addresses.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eApple invested extensively to develop Private Cloud Compute to maintain strong security and privacy guarantees for AI processing in the cloud.

Which is to say, altering DNA was a messy, labor-intensive process of loading genes onto viruses bound for target cells. It involved more than a fair amount of finger-crossing. Today, scientists have the genetic equivalent of Microsoft Word, and they are beginning to edit DNA almost as easily as software engineers modify code. The precipitating event?

As they did, they found Crisprs everywhere—more than half of the bacterial kingdom turned out to have them. Oftentimes those sequences were flanked by a set of genes coding for a class of strand-cutting enzymes called endonucleases. Scientists suspected they were involved in this primitive immune system, but how, exactly?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe key insight came from a particularly nasty bug—the one that causes strep throat. Its Crispr system made two RNA sequences that attached to a clam-shaped endonuclease called Cas9. Like a genetic GPS, those sequences directed the enzyme to a strand of DNA complementary to the RNA sequences. When it got there, Cas9 changed shape, grabbing the DNA and slicing it in two. The molecular biologists who made this discovery—Jennifer Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier—demonstrated Crispr’s programmable cutting on circular stretches of DNA floating in test tubes.

Though scientists have devised some methods for doing so, these approaches can have potentially harmful consequences: Crispr, when administered in this way, can wreak havoc on portions of the genome where it should never have been in the first place. These unintended modifications, called off-target effects, could theoretically prevent tissues from functioning properly or could jump-start cancers. Figuring out how to limit these off-target effects is a major goal of current Crispr research. And scientists have made some material progress.

AI song generators, which allow people to “create” music by selecting or customizing prompts about what the tunes should sound like, now have millions of users but were then a niche product. Smith was, it must be said, ahead of the curve here—few people appreciated then how omnipresent AI would become in the music world. In the government’s indictment, Mitchell fits the description of an unnamed, not-charged co-conspirator: Starting around 2018, a “Chief Executive Officer of an AI music company” provided Smith with “thousands of songs each week.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Keep in mind what we’re doing musically here ...,” the CEO wrote, per the indictment. “This is not ‘music,’ it’s ‘instant music’ ;).” Smith allegedly assigned the AI songs to fake artists. The songs had otherworldly, -dictionary-scraping names: “Zygophyceae,” “Zygophyllaceae,” “Zygopteraceae.” The fake artists were equally odd, with names such as “Calm Force,” “Calm Knuckles,” “Calms Scorching,” and “Calorie Event.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAccording to the indictment, Smith uploaded the music onto streaming platforms and, with the help of contractors, created thousands of accounts. Using “small pieces of computer code” that he’d bought, Smith was able to “continuously” play the music on those accounts—essentially commanding a custom bot army to play his AI tracks nonstop. Those plays triggered royalty payments. In other words, Smith was—if the allegations are true—cementing his status as a master purveyor of AI slop. Indeed, the ranks of AI slopstars are filling up fast with the hustlers flooding Amazon with crappy robo-books and the schemers gobbling up websites and turning them into AI content mills.

The pair’s fighting intensified. “You steal from streaming platforms,” he accused Smith via email in December 2019. “These are federal crimes, bro.” Smith responded by resending the pair’s legal agreement. Hay claims that Smith cut him out of deals and withheld income—and it made him snap. Hay dashed off another jeremiad to their associates. He wrote to Billboard employees and other people in their professional network outlining his suspicions. This time, Hay says, he was ready to cut ties. He says he went to the local police and even the FBI: “I blew the whistle as loud as I could.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut then—once again—nothing happened. A Billboard employee eventually texted Hay that the company had decided not to pursue an investigation. (Billboard declined to comment on this particular incident, though a spokesperson for Penske Media Corporation, which now owns and operates Billboard, noted that it will remove inaccurate records if it is made aware of the problem in a timely fashion. Billboard records from Smith and Hay still stand.) Embarrassed, Hay told the Billboard team that he had gone off his medication. He certainly felt crazy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eSmith, meanwhile, wasn’t having a great time either. He was navigating a lawsuit from staffers at his medical offices, who claimed that his clinics had engaged in Medicaid and Medicare fraud. The lawsuit alleges that Smith was moving money from the clinics into SMH Records, which was something Hay had suspected. Smith and his codefendants reached a settlement in 2020, requiring them to pay $900,000.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNevertheless, by 2022 Smith seemed to be back on a roll. He produced a song featuring Snoop Dogg and Billy Ray Cyrus. He was also lining up a slate of ambitious projects—including a horror movie with RZA and an animated series in which a cartoon Smith would travel to the afterlife, set to music by Snoop Dogg and RZA. (Neither Snoop Dogg nor RZA responded to requests for comment.) But success turns on a dime in this business, and by the following year something appeared to have changed. Smith went silent on Insta-gram. The horror movie came out without much fanfare. According to a timeline included in the criminal indictment, Smith was spending at least some of that time trying to convince groups within the streaming industry that he was legitimate. Then, in spring 2023, he received a notice that dealt a major blow. The Mechanical Licensing Collective, a nonprofit entity that collects and dispenses royalties for streaming services, had confronted Smith about fraud and was now halting payments. A crucial money spigot had turned off.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn September 4, 2024, federal agents pulled up to Smith’s sprawling Colonial Revival–style brick home. They handcuffed him and perp-walked him out to their navy sprinter van, past his three-car garage, as befuddled neighbors looked on.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor Hay, the arrest was a vindication. In the indictment, Hay—who fits the description of an unnamed “Co-Conspirator 2” and is not charged with a crime—comes across as something of a patsy, the person whose work Smith used to “fraudulently generate royalty payments” before pivoting to AI. Other people in Smith’s orbit have expressed surprise. Music promoter Bram Bessoff, who is registered as a cowriter on hundreds of Smith’s AI songs, expressed “total shock” to WIRED and says he’s cooperating with authorities. (While Bessoff is neither named nor charged in the indictment, “Co-Conspirator 4” is described as a music promoter.) Meanwhile, Boomy CEO Alex Mitchell, who was also registered on hundreds of the songs along with Bessoff and Smith, declined to respond to questions. A spokesperson for Boomy, Phoebe Myers, told WIRED that neither Mitchell nor Boomy “had any knowledge or involvement in Smith’s alleged criminal conduct,” nor had they “engaged in bot streaming or knew of any bot streaming by Smith.” Myers adds that Mitchell did not have any relationship with Smith’s music publishing company.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIncluded in the government’s indictment is an excerpt from a jubilant email Smith sent to his co-conspirators (the ones who sound an awful lot like Mitchell and Bessoff). In it, he wrote about how they’d be receiving 10 percent cuts on the royalties generated by the songs: “We are at 88 million TOTAL STREAMS so far!!!”\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure class='AssetEmbedWrapper-eVDQiB byBkf asset-embed'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cpicture class='ResponsiveImagePicture-cWuUZO dUOtEa AssetEmbedResponsiveAsset-cXBNxi lqMXz asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image'\u003e\u003cimg src='https://media.wired.com/photos/6824dfd3039495718e24bc3e/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Spot_02_WithMotion.gif' alt='‘A Billion Streams and No Fans Inside a 10 Million AI Music Fraud Case'\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eTechnically, it’s not\u003c/span\u003e  illegal to make a bonkers amount of AI-generated music and put it on a streaming service. Tacky, yes. Disrespectful to the art form, probably. But not necessarily against the law. In fact, it’s pretty common: Deezer, a French music streaming platform, estimates that 10 percent of the songs uploaded every day are AI-generated. If a company were to train its song generator on copyrighted music without permission, it could run into trouble if music labels alleged that use case was illegal, as happened to Suno and Udio, two companies that are now the subject of lawsuits. Boomy appears to be aboveboard on this count—it has been certified by Fairly Trained, a nonprofit that checks whether generative AI companies got consent to use their training materials. So the first part of Smith’s (alleged) scheme might, at most, be violating laws of good taste.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen there are the bots and fake accounts. Major streaming services often prohibit their use in their terms of service. Last year, a man in Denmark was found guilty of committing music streaming fraud by using bots to play his music on Spotify and Apple Music. Still, the vast majority of such behavior goes unpunished. Morgan Hayduk, the co-CEO of a streaming-fraud-detection startup called Beatdapp, has monitored whole networks of bad actors siphoning money from streamers. “Conservatively, it’s a billion-dollar-a-year type of problem,” Hayduk says. “The Michael Smith case is the tip of the iceberg.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA 2021 study by France’s National Music Center found that around 1 to 3 percent of all streams were fraudulent; Beatdapp puts that number at around 10 percent. According to Hayduk, some of the startup’s clients consistently flag 17 to 25 percent of streams as fraudulent, and occasionally as many as half. As he sees it, AI song generators are a “supercharger” for this behavior, and Smith’s alleged scheme isn’t especially cutting-edge. “If you’re a sophisticated, organized criminal,” Hayduk says, “you would do this from the comfort of a beach in a non-extradition country.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt remains unclear which streaming companies ended up paying Smith the most money, probably because nobody wants to admit their detection efforts flopped. Spotify, the industry’s behemoth, claims that its fraud detection programs caught Smith’s alleged chicanery. “It appears our preventative measures worked and limited the royalties Smith was able to generate from Spotify to approximately $60,000 of the $10 million,” says Laura Batey, a company spokesperson. Apple, YouTube Music, and Tidal did not respond to questions; Amazon declined to answer questions about Smith. While distributors and streaming services are leaning on sophisticated fraud detection in an AI-versus-AI war, some industry experts argue that the real problem is the streaming companies’ royalty payment structures and that only a total overhaul can curb the problem.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn some corners of the music world, Smith isn’t seen as a villain. Musicians often accuse streaming platforms, and of course labels, of ripping off artists. Goldy Locks, Smith’s former client, says some people view him as a modern-day Robin Hood. Others see him as a man who exploited an exploitative system, a creature native to a grift-addled environment. After all, radio invented payola, and Spotify inserts bulk-produced stock songs into popular playlists. The line between organic and paid audiences has always been blurry. Even in 19th-century France, “claqueurs” were paid to fill opera houses and clap.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSmith is now out on bail. His lawyer, Noell Tin, said in a statement that “Mike Smith is a successful songwriter, musical artist, devoted husband, and father to six children. He looks forward to responding to the charges against him in court.” The case, brought in the US Southern District Court of New York, will be heard by Judge John Koeltl, who has a history with consequential tech lawsuits, including a ruling against the Internet Archive and an ongoing case against the crypto hub Binance. If found guilty, Smith faces up to 60 years in prison. Either way, Smith has earned a seat in the music business pantheon: The government has cast him as an avatar for the AI era’s gifts to grifters. Anybody can click a few buttons and make a song now. But building a fortune off these audienceless ditties? From one angle, it might be a crime. From another, it’s a new art.\u003c/p\u003e\u003chr class='my-4 border-t border-gray-300'\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem class='italic'\u003eLet us know what you think about this article.

This interpretation of presidential power finds that troops may be deployed in an effort to “protect federal property and functions.” Notably—unlike the Insurrection Act—this does not permit troops to engage in activities that are generally the purview of civilian law enforcement agencies.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTrump also invoked statutory power granted to him by Congress  \u003ca href='https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/12406' class='link'\u003eunder Title 10\u003c/a\u003e  of the US Code, which enabled him to federalize elements of California’s National Guard. These activations typically occur when guardsmen are needed to support overseas military operations, as happened routinely this century during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Domestically, however, guardsmen are not usually federalized without the agreement of a state’s governor—unless the Insurrection Act has been invoked.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLegal experts interviewed by WIRED offered a range of opinions on the president’s authority to deploy active-duty military troops or federalize the National Guard. While most believe it is likely within Trump’s power to ignore Newsom’s express objections, doing so without an invocation of the Insurrection Act, they say, is a decision fraught with legal complexities that carries serious implications, from altering—perhaps permanently—the fundamental relationship between Americans, states, and the federal government, to disturbing the delicate balance between civilian governance and military power.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLiza Goitein, senior director of the Brennan Center\u0026#39;s Liberty and National Security Program, underscores the “unprecedented” nature of Trump’s approach. “He’s trying to basically exercise the powers of the Insurrection Act without invoking it,” she says. A key issue for Goitein is that the  \u003ca href='https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/06/department-of-defense-security-for-the-protection-of-department-of-homeland-security-functions/' class='link'\u003ememorandum\u003c/a\u003e  signed by Trump last week federalizing the National Guard makes no mention of Los Angeles or California. Rather, it states that the guardsmen are being mobilized to address protests that are both “occurring” and “likely to occur.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn essence, the memo “authorizes the deployment of federal troops anywhere in the country,” Goitein says, “including places where there are no protests yet. We’re talking about preemptive deployment.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGoitein argues that the administration’s justifications could undermine both judicial accountability and civil‑military boundaries. Under the Insurrection Act, federal troops can take on the responsibilities of local and state police. But without it, their authority should be quite limited. Neither the guardsmen nor the Marines, for instance, should engage with protesters acting peacefully, according to Goitein. “He says they’re there to protect federal property,” she says. “But it looks a lot like quelling civil unrest.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnthony Kuhn, a 28-year US Army veteran and managing partner at Tully Rinckey, believes, meanwhile, that there is really “no question” that Trump would be justified in declaring a “violent rebellion” underway in California, empowering him to ignore Newsom’s objections. The images and video of protesters hurling rocks and other items at police and lighting cars on fire all serve as evidence toward that conclusion.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“I know people in California, the governor, the mayor, are trying to frame it as a protest. But at this point,” says Kuhn, “it’s a violent rebellion. You can draw your own conclusions from the pictures and videos floating around.” Kuhn argues that the intentions of the protesters, the politics fueling the demonstrations, don’t matter. “They’re attacking federal facilities. They’re destroying federal property. So in an attempt to restore the peace, the president has the authority under Title 10 to deploy troops. It’s pretty straightforward.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn contrast, Rutgers University professor Bruce Afran says deploying military forces against Americans is “completely unconstitutional” in the absence of a true state of domestic insurrection. “There was an attack on ICE’s offices, the doorways, there was some graffiti, there were images of protesters breaking into a guardhouse, which was empty,” he says. “But even if it went to the point of setting a car on fire, that\u0026#39;s not a domestic insurrection. That\u0026#39;s a protest that is engaged in some illegality. And we have civil means to punish it without the armed forces.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfran argues that meddling with the expectations of civilians, who naturally anticipate interacting with police but not armed soldiers, can fundamentally alter the relationship between citizens and their government, even blurring the line between democracy and authoritarianism. “The long-term danger is that we come to accept the role of the army in regulating civilian protest instead of allowing local law enforcement to do the job,” he says. “And once we accept that new paradigm—to use a kind of BS word—the relationship between the citizen and the government is altered forever.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Violent rioters in Los Angeles, enabled by Democrat governor Gavin Newsom, have attacked American law enforcement, set cars on fire, and fueled lawless chaos,\u0026#34; Abigail Jackson, a White House spokesperson, tells WIRED. \u0026#34;President Trump rightfully stepped in to protect federal law enforcement officers.

When you look at the chain of command, it envisions the governor controlling all of these individuals.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSeparately, says Coombs, when troops are ordered to mobilize, they could—again, hypothetically—refuse to engage in activities that are beyond the scope of the president’s orders, such as carrying out immigration raids or making arrests. “All they can do in this case, under Title 10 status, is protect the safety of federal personnel and property. If you go beyond that, then it violates the Posse Comitatus Act.” Federal troops, for instance, would need civilian police to step in at the point that local authorities want peaceful protesters to disperse.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe San Francisco Chronicle  \u003ca href='https://www.sfchronicle.com/us-world/article/noem-immigration-protests-letter-20369001.php' class='link'\u003ereports\u003c/a\u003e  that, in a letter on Sunday, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem requested that military troops be directed to detain alleged “lawbreakers” during protests “or arrest them,” which legal experts almost universally agree would be illegal under ordinary circumstances.

After a series of legal defeats at the hands of broadband providers, the FCC passed a sweeping net neutrality order in 2015. But in December 2017, the now Republican-controlled FCC voted to jettison that order, freeing broadband providers to block or throttle content as they see fit unless Congress or the courts block the agency\u0026#39;s decision.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eNet neutrality advocates have long argued that keeping the internet an open playing field is crucial for innovation. If broadband providers pick favorites online, new companies and technologies might never have the chance to grow. For example, had internet providers blocked or severely limited video streaming in the mid-2000s, we might not have Netflix or YouTube today. Other advocates highlight the importance of net neutrality to free expression: a handful of large telecommunications companies dominate the broadband market, which puts an enormous amount of power into their hands to suppress particular views or limit online speech to those who can pay the most.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eMost large broadband providers promised not to block or throttle content ahead of the ruling,  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/video-phone-slow-not-your-imagination/' class='link'\u003ebut all four major mobile carriers\u003c/a\u003e  began slowing down at least some video content before the FCC had fully repealed the rules.

At the time, some broadband providers, including Comcast, banned home internet users from accessing virtual private networks (VPNs), while others, like AT\u0026amp;T, banned users from using Wi-Fi routers. Wu worried that broadband providers\u0026#39; tendency to restrict new technologies would hurt innovation in the long term, and called for anti-discrimination rules.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Bush-era FCC took a first pass at anti-discrimination rules for the internet in a policy statement in 2005. It prohibited internet service providers from blocking legal content or preventing customers from connecting the devices of their choosing to their internet connections. Under this policy, the FCC ordered Comcast in 2008 to stop slowing connections that used the peer-to-peer file-sharing software BitTorrent, which was often used for digital piracy but also had legitimate uses. Comcast sued the FCC, arguing the agency had overstepped its bounds. A federal court agreed, ruling that the FCC had failed to make the legal case that it had the authority to enforce the 2005 policy statement.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003caside class='Sidebar-pgAgH kmwJca'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eWait, What\u0026#39;s a Common Carrier Again?\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eCertain services and businesses have been seen as so crucial to the functioning of society and the economy that governments  \u003ca href='http://www.columbia.edu/dlc/wp/citi/citinoam11.html' class='link'\u003edating back to Ancient Rome\u003c/a\u003e  have passed special laws to ensure open access to them. In exchange for serving the entire public, as opposed to being able to pick and choose customers, common carriers were often rewarded with legal benefits, such as special access to public property. For example, railroads—long treated as common carriers in the US—are allowed to lay tracks across public land. Today, telephone providers are classified as common carriers, and in the dialup era internet providers were considered to be their customers. If it hadn\u0026#39;t been for their common carrier status, telcos might have gotten away with charging customers more to access the internet than to make traditional voice calls, as they  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/1997/06/netizen-28/' class='link'\u003etried to do in the 1990s\u003c/a\u003e .\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn 2010, the Obama-era FCC passed a more detailed net neutrality order that it hoped would stand up to legal scrutiny. But the agency was sued again, this time by Verizon, and in 2014 the same court ruled the agency didn\u0026#39;t have the authority to impose net neutrality regulations on services that weren\u0026#39;t considered common carriers under Title II of the Communications Act, like traditional telephone services.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLater that year, the FCC floated a new proposal that net neutrality proponents worried would allow internet \u0026#34;fast lanes.\u0026#34; The idea drew the ire of comedian John Oliver, who encouraged viewers of his show  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eLast Week Tonight\u003c/em\u003e  to file comments to express their support for net neutrality.

The same federal court that shot down the FCC’s previous attempts at net neutrality rules finally sided with the agency, ruling that the 2015 rules were legal.

The FCC\u0026#39;s new rules drop the common-carrier status for broadband providers, as well as any restrictions on blocking or throttling content. In place of those restrictions, the new rules only require that internet service providers disclose information about their network-management practices. It will now be up to the Federal Trade Commission to protect consumers from alleged net neutrality violations. But the FTC is only an enforcement agency: It can’t create new rules. That means that unless a net neutrality violation is also illegal under existing fair-competition laws, there’s not much the agency can do about it. Outright blocking a competitor may well be an antitrust violation, but creating fast lanes for companies that pay extra for special treatment might not be.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cfigure class='AssetEmbedWrapper-eVDQiB byBkf asset-embed'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cpicture class='ResponsiveImagePicture-cWuUZO dUOtEa AssetEmbedResponsiveAsset-cXBNxi lqMXz asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image'\u003e\u003cimg src='https://media.wired.com/photos/5a726e8cd107c842c752925b/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/whatsnext.jpg' alt='What Is Net Neutrality The Complete WIRED Guide'\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eThe Future of Net Neutrality\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe future of net neutrality is now in the hands of Congress, the courts, and the states.

Consolidated sectors, meanwhile, find it easy to sing with one voice, blocking the passage of unfavorable regulation (there\u0026#39;s still no US national privacy law) or its enforcement (the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation shows that Ireland is even more valuable as a lawless regulation haven than it ever was as a mere tax haven).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eUndisciplined by competition or regulation, platforms are free to slide into “ \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/tiktok-platforms-cory-doctorow/' class='link'\u003eenshittification\u003c/a\u003e ,” in which the company extracts value from both sides of the two-sided market, relying on lock-in to keep users and business customers from defecting to a rival. The year 2023 was when the platforms soured: Twitch, Reddit, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Google Search, and Discord all spiraled into terminal enshittification, transferring value from users to shareholders, leaving behind shambling half-dead things that were disagreeable, but un-quittable.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe secret to that un-quittability is high “switching costs”—the economists’ term for the things you have to give up to leave a service. You hate Facebook, but you love connecting with your communities, friends, and customers. They’re holding you hostage on Facebook’s behalf—and you’re holding them hostage, too. Facebook literally banks on these high switching costs: The US Federal Trade Commission’s antitrust case against Facebook revealed internal memos in which a product manager explicitly sets out to design features that  \u003ca href='https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/facebooks-secret-war-switching-costs#:~:text=In%20several%20places%2C%20the%20FTC,to%20a%20better%2C%20rival%20service.' class='link'\u003e“make switching costs very high for users”\u003c/a\u003e  in order to make it “very tough for a user to switch” to a rival service.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRegulators are increasingly alive to the fact that Big Tech deliberately designs its products to impose high costs on users who have the temerity to prefer their competitors. If a company fails to offer official means for users to take their data with them, or to continue to communicate with the contacts they leave behind when they change platforms, those users have little recourse. The once-common practice of reverse-engineering a rival platform to make an unofficial, interoperable bridge—say, a tool that scrapes your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and other messages for a common inbox on a new, privacy-respecting service—have been effectively outlawed by anti-circumvention laws, patents, copyrights, and exotic contract theories like “tortious interference.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eDespite these barriers to exit that keep users tethered to bad platforms, most of the regulatory response to Big Tech has been aimed at making it better, rather than making it easier to leave.

It’s the ability to leave a service, set up elsewhere, and resume the conversations and transactions you left behind.

If the bill passes, they\u0026#39;ll have broad latitude to fashion remedies for each dominant service, including interoperability mandates obliging walled gardens to install gateways for new market entrants, making it easy for users to leave without isolating themselves from important social relationships.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the US, multiple interoperability bills with broad bipartisan support have made it out of committee, only to be denied a vote after intense lobbying by the tech sector.

In the next year, Goode says, the company is planning to expand beyond antidepressants and begin offering tapering programs for stimulants and benzodiazepines, two classes of drug that are commonly prescribed in the US for issues like anxiety and ADHD and are known to cause intense withdrawal symptoms.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e“I was kind of waiting for something like Outro to exist,” says Sharf, who became one of the company’s first patients in the United States last June as part of a pilot program in California. “Everything was tailored around how I wanted to do it.” Twelve months later, Sharf says she is still tapering off her medication with help from Outro at a pace that works for her.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen customers sign up for Outro and get matched with clinicians, they then typically follow a tapering method endorsed by one of Outro’s other cofounders, the British academic psychiatrist Mark Horowitz. Known as “hyperbolic tapering,” it’s a substantially more drawn-out process than other methods used to help people get off meds.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eUnlike a linear taper, which involves reducing the dose of a medication by the same amount each time, a hyperbolic taper gradually slows the rate of reduction—cutting smaller and smaller amounts as it goes—so that the final doses are extremely small and spread out over a much longer period. To facilitate this, Outro partners with compounding pharmacies to produce custom versions of generic antidepressants in minuscule doses that are not available commercially. In other words, while Outro promotes itself as a service for getting off medication, part of its business model hinges on people continuing to take the compounded drugs its clinicians prescribe.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHorowitz, who has become one of the UK\u0026#39;s leading experts on medication tapering, known as de-prescribing, says his interest in the topic was driven by his own harrowing experience coming off antidepressants more than a decade ago when he was a psychiatry doctoral student. Horowitz crafted a gradual tapering plan for himself that involved using syringes from his research lab to dole out small liquid doses of escitalopram, known by the brand name Lexapro. But he couldn’t prevent the misery induced by discontinuing the drug.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“My life exploded,” Horowitz says. His symptoms, which included severe insomnia and dizziness, were so debilitating that he moved back in with his parents. “It took me years to come off, not weeks as guidelines recommended.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter he recovered, Horowitz began pushing for doctors to adopt new clinical guidelines for getting off antidepressants. He coauthored the Royal College of Psychiatry\u0026#39;s guidance for psychiatric drug cessation and joined the UK’s National Health Service as a clinical research fellow. His goal with Outro is to bring the guided tapering methods he has developed to a new patient base in North America.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGoode, Outro’s CEO, has a background working in pharmaceuticals and telehealth that includes stints at Novo Nordisk and the psychedelic therapy startup Field Trip Health, now known as Stella. “People kept asking how to use psychedelics to get off antidepressants,” Goode says, which led him to suspect there might be a substantial swath of the population who wanted help quitting the drugs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHorowitz and Goode cofounded Outro in 2022 along with another Field Trip alum, Tyler Dyck. The company’s small team also includes Adele Framer, the founder of Surviving Antidepressants, a long-running forum where people swap tips on how to taper off this class of medication.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s a fraught moment to be launching a health startup in the US focused on getting people off psychiatric drugs. The US secretary of health and human services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has questioned whether the medications are overprescribed, and has  \u003ca href='https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/rfk-jr-health-stances-vaccines-fluoride-raw-milk-rcna180244' class='link'\u003emade false claims\u003c/a\u003e  linking antidepressants to school shootings and increased violence.

Anders Sørenson, a clinical psychologist in Denmark specializing in psychiatric de-prescribing, says the status quo for most patients is “not just inadequate, but often actively harmful.” He sees an urgent need for more doctors to craft hyperbolic tapering plans customized to each individual patient’s needs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSome psychiatry experts push back on the idea that hyperbolic tapering programs are necessary for many patients. Jonathan E. Alpert, a psychiatrist and professor at Montefiore’s Albert Einstein College of Medicine, agrees that taking a thoughtful approach to tapering is important and says hyperbolic tapering “makes some sense neurobiologically.” But he thinks a large portion of people who want to quit psychiatric drugs can do so by using what he considers to be “less fussy” methods, like gradually halving doses, rather than relying on “an extremely precise, extremely elaborate and potentially resource-intensive approach to a problem that usually can be handled in a much more straightforward way.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHorowitz sees his work with Outro as part of a larger mission to shift the public conversation about the root causes of psychological problems. While he doesn’t want to discourage people who need medication from taking it, he believes that the level of chronic SSRI use happening today should be carefully evaluated to ensure social factors contributing to mental health issues are not being overlooked. “To me, it is actually a very leftist issue to de-medicalize the way we treat anxiety and depression,” he says, noting that such illnesses are often caused “by social circumstances, by poverty, by loneliness.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOutro is making the opposite pitch of most  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/telehealth-pivot-liraglutide-fda-shortage/' class='link'\u003eonline health startups\u003c/a\u003e , offering to help people stop drugs rather than start them.

We’re talking about seeing around corners: At MIT, researchers have  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/mit-wizards-invent-tech-that-sees-around-corners/' class='link'\u003edeveloped a system\u003c/a\u003e  that watches the floor at the corner of, say, a hallway, and picks out subtle movements being reflected from the other side that the piddling human eye can’t see. Such technology could one day ensure that robots don’t crash into humans in labyrinthine buildings, and even allow self-driving cars to see occluded scenes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWithin each of these robots is the next secret ingredient: the  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/robots-are-fueling-the-silent-ascendance-of-the-electric-motor/' class='link'\u003eactuator\u003c/a\u003e , which is a fancy word for the combo electric motor and gearbox that you’ll find in a robot’s joint. It’s this actuator that determines how strong a robot is and how smoothly or  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/2015/06/stop-laughing-clumsy-humanoid-robots/' class='link'\u003enot smoothly it moves\u003c/a\u003e . Without actuators, robots would crumple like rag dolls. Even relatively simple robots like Roombas owe their existence to actuators. Self-driving cars, too, are loaded with the things.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eActuators are great for powering massive robot arms on a car assembly line, but a newish field, known as soft robotics, is devoted to creating actuators that operate on a whole new level. Unlike mule robots, soft robots are generally squishy, and use air or oil to get themselves moving. So for instance, one particular kind of robot muscle uses electrodes to squeeze a pouch of oil, expanding and contracting to  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/a-clever-new-robotic-muscle-seriously-lifts-bro/' class='link'\u003etug on weights\u003c/a\u003e . Unlike with bulky traditional actuators, you could stack a bunch of these to magnify the strength: A robot named Kengoro, for instance, moves with 116 actuators that tug on cables, allowing the machine to do  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/a-freaky-humanoid-robot-that-sweats-as-it-does-push-ups/' class='link'\u003eunsettlingly human maneuvers like pushups\u003c/a\u003e . It’s a far more natural-looking form of movement than what you’d get with traditional electric motors housed in the joints.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd then there’s Boston Dynamics, which created the Atlas humanoid robot for the Darpa Robotics Challenge in 2013. At first, university robotics research teams struggled to get the machine to tackle the basic tasks of the original 2013 challenge and the finals round in 2015, like turning valves and opening doors. But Boston Dynamics has since that time turned Atlas into a marvel that can  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/atlas-robot-does-backflips-now/' class='link'\u003edo backflips\u003c/a\u003e , far outpacing other bipeds that still have a hard time walking. (Unlike the Terminator, though, it does not pack heat.) Boston Dynamics has also begun leasing a quadruped robot called Spot, which can recover in unsettling fashion when humans kick or  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/watch-a-human-try-to-fight-off-that-door-opening-robot-dog/' class='link'\u003etug on it\u003c/a\u003e . That kind of stability will be key if we want to build a world where we don’t spend all our time helping robots out of jams.

Then the researchers transferred that knowledge to the real robot in the lab, and sure enough, the thing could walk—in fact, it walked even faster than the robot manufacturer’s default gait, though in fairness it was less stable.\u003c/p\u003e\u003chr class='my-4 border-t border-gray-300'\u003e\u003ch2 class='text-xl font-semibold'\u003e13 Robots, Real and Imagined\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003chr class='my-4 border-t border-gray-300'\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cul class='list-disc pl-5 space-y-2'\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure class='GallerySlideFigure-jhDfjI bGQGmP'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cpicture class='ResponsiveImagePicture-cWuUZO dUOtEa GallerySlideResponsiveAsset-bXKMLC lluiXZ GallerySlideResponsiveAsset responsive-image'\u003e\u003cimg src='https://media.wired.com/photos/5afa24a3d766e66bd3ee2e8f/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/RS1-486781089.jpg' alt='Image may contain Art Painting Wood Figurine Human and Person' class='mt-4 p-2 max-w-full h-auto rounded shadow-sm'\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure class='GallerySlideFigure-jhDfjI bGQGmP'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cpicture class='ResponsiveImagePicture-cWuUZO dUOtEa GallerySlideResponsiveAsset-bXKMLC lluiXZ GallerySlideResponsiveAsset responsive-image'\u003e\u003cimg src='https://media.wired.com/photos/5afa249e61a771153edd20bc/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/RS2-D90ABP.jpg' alt='Image may contain Human Person Elvira Bach and Jury' class='mt-4 p-2 max-w-full h-auto rounded shadow-sm'\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure class='GallerySlideFigure-jhDfjI bGQGmP'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cpicture class='ResponsiveImagePicture-cWuUZO dUOtEa GallerySlideResponsiveAsset-bXKMLC lluiXZ GallerySlideResponsiveAsset responsive-image'\u003e\u003cimg src='https://media.wired.com/photos/5afa249d386af04fdfac622e/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/RS3-MCDMETR_EC024.jpg' alt='Image may contain Human Person Robot Transportation Vehicle Bike Bicycle Clothing and Apparel' class='mt-4 p-2 max-w-full h-auto rounded shadow-sm'\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan\u003e1 \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e/ 13\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbutton class='BaseButton-bLlsy ButtonWrapper-xCepQ fhIjxp fCyinQ button button--utility GalleryEmbedControlsButton-dA-dlPo iknpPJ'\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003csvg class='ButtonIcon-YqaGo iwlhuX button-icon icon icon-chevron'\u003e\u003ctitle\u003eChevron\u003c/title\u003e\u003c/svg\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/button\u003e\u003cbutton class='BaseButton-bLlsy ButtonWrapper-xCepQ fhIjxp fCyinQ button button--utility GalleryEmbedControlsButton-dA-dlPo iwuBQp'\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003csvg class='ButtonIcon-YqaGo iwlhuX button-icon icon icon-chevron'\u003e\u003ctitle\u003eChevron\u003c/title\u003e\u003c/svg\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/button\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cfigcaption class='GalleryEmbedCaptionWrapper-eUYjyD cYOJII'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eHeritage Images/Getty Images\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003ePygmalion (Ancient Greece)\u003c/strong\u003e The start of it all.

The overarching challenge is this: It’s easy enough to adapt robots to get along with humans—make them soft and give them a sense of touch—but it’s another issue entirely to train humans to get along with the machines. With Tug the hospital robot, for example, doctors and nurses learn to treat it like a grandparent—get the hell out of its way and help it get unstuck if you have to. We also have to manage our expectations: Robots like Atlas may  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eseem\u003c/em\u003e  advanced, but they’re far from the autonomous wonders you might think.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat humanity has done is essentially invented a new species, and now we’re maybe having a little buyers’ remorse. Namely, what if the robots steal all our jobs? Not even white-collar workers are safe from hyper-intelligent AI, after all.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA lot of smart people are thinking about the singularity, when the machines grow advanced enough to make humanity obsolete. That will result in a massive societal realignment and species-wide existential crisis. What will we do if we no longer have to work? How does income inequality look anything other than exponentially more dire as industries replace people with machines?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThese seem like far-out problems, but now is the time to start pondering them. Which you might consider an upside to the killer-robot narrative that Hollywood has fed us all these years: The machines may be limited at the moment, but we as a society need to think seriously about how much power we want to cede. Take San Francisco, for instance, which is exploring the idea of a robot tax, which would force companies to pay up when they displace human workers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI can’t sit here and promise you that the robots won’t one day  \u003ca href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IojqOMWTgv8' class='link'\u003eturn us all into batteries\u003c/a\u003e , but the more realistic scenario is that, unlike in the world of  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eR.U.R.\u003c/em\u003e , humans and robots are poised to live in harmony—because it’s already happening.

If your car has adaptive cruise control, you’re already doing this, letting the robot handle the boring highway work while you take over for the complexity of city driving. The fact that the US economy ground to a standstill during the coronavirus pandemic made it abundantly clear that robots  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/robot-jobs-coronavirus/' class='link'\u003eare nowhere near ready\u003c/a\u003e  to replace humans en masse.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe machines promise to change virtually every aspect of human life, from health care to transportation to work.

Right now, Bluesky feels like Twitter, Flashes like Instagram, Skylight like TikTok. But you can build or combine things in totally new ways, or build social experiences that aren’t necessarily large mainstream social apps. Those kinds of experiences are what I’m excited to see unleashed. The long-term vision is not just for a new form of social apps but a new layer for the web—what Web3 aspired to be, without the blockchain.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eI’m having a flashback to a conversation I had a decade ago.

Some groups in the book world fiercely support its digital lending; others fiercely oppose it. I see a similar tension brewing among Bluesky power users. Some people want the app to be more active in content moderation, but that seems to clash with the principles of decentralization, where ideally no one body can ban or block people.

The people who have created starter packs, created feeds, and gotten involved in the community have seen a lot of growth—even if they previously weren’t big posters elsewhere. For creators, nobody is fully grasping that this is potentially the last social identity you have to create.

In 2023 its emissions were still rising. This is partly due to its continued recovery from Covid-19. An ongoing drought also means its hydropower output has dropped.

For decades, scientists have carefully accumulated data that confirms what we hoped wasn’t true: The greenhouse gas emissions that have steadily spewed from cars and planes and factories, the technologies that powered a massive period of economic growth, came at an enormous cost to the planet’s health. Today, we know that, absent any change in our behavior, the average global temperature will rise as much as 4 degrees Celsius by the end of the century. Global sea levels will rise by up to 6 feet. Along with those shifts will come radical changes in weather patterns around the globe, leaving coastal communities and equatorial regions forever changed—and potentially uninhabitable.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStrike that. We are already seeing the effects of a dramatically changed climate, from extended wildfire seasons to worsening storm surges.

In the late 1700s, as coal-fired factories started churning out steel and textiles, the United States and other developed nations began pumping out its byproducts. Coal is a carbon-rich fuel, so when it combusts with oxygen, it produces heat along with another byproduct: carbon dioxide. Other carbon-based fuels, like natural gas, do the same in different proportions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen those emissions entered the atmosphere, they acted like an insulating blanket, preventing the sun’s heat from escaping into space. Over the course of history, atmospheric carbon dioxide levels have varied—a lot. Models of ancient climate activity, hundreds of millions of years back, put carbon dioxide levels as high as several thousand parts per million. In the past half-million years or so, they’ve fluctuated between about 180 and 300 parts per million. But they haven\u0026#39;t fluctuated this fast. Today, atmospheric CO~2~ is at 407 ppm—roughly one and a half times as high as it was just two centuries ago. And we know for certain that extra greenhouse gas is from humans; analysis of the carbon isotopes in the atmosphere show that the majority of the extra CO~2~ comes from fossil fuels.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure class='AssetEmbedWrapper-eVDQiB byBkf asset-embed'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cpicture class='ResponsiveImagePicture-cWuUZO dUOtEa AssetEmbedResponsiveAsset-cXBNxi lqMXz asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image'\u003e\u003cimg src='https://media.wired.com/photos/5a712213c519953a525f7aaf/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/greenhouse-01.png' alt='Image may contain Nature Outdoors Universe Space Astronomy Outer Space and Night'\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cp\u003eRadiation from the sun hits the Earth’s atmosphere.

There’s global warming, of course; the Earth’s average temperature has increased 1.1 degrees Celsius since the late 19th century. But it goes further. As oceans absorb heat and polar ice sheets melt, hurricane seasons become more severe as warm water from the oceans kicks warm, moist air into the atmosphere. Sea levels rise—about 8 inches in the past century. Critically, the rate of these changes is increasing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of the more visible consequences of climate change is playing out in California.

And in 1988, that bulk of research led to the founding of the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which has now issued five assessment reports documenting all the available scientific, technical, and economic information on climate change. The fourth report, in 2007, was the first to clearly state that the climate was unequivocally warming—and that human-created greenhouse gases were very likely to blame.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJust because the panel came to a consensus doesn’t mean everyone else did, though. In 2009, climate scientists had their own WikiLeaks scandal, when climate deniers released a trove of emails from scientists, including the one behind the famous 1999 “hockey stick” graph showing a sharp upturn in global temperature after the Industrial Revolution—one that was clearly sharper than the many global warmings and coolings the Earth has seen. Excerpts taken out of context from those emails showed that researcher, Michael Mann, purportedly conspiring to statistically manipulate his data.

But in 2015, the world’s leaders appeared to transcend those squabbles. On December 12, after two weeks of deliberations at the 21st United Nations Conference on Climate Change in Le Bourget, France, 195 countries agreed on the language in what’s known as the Paris agreement. The goal is to keep average global temperature increase to below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-Industrial levels, and as close to 1.5 degrees as possible. It does so by having each country submit a commitment to reduce emissions and collectively bear the economic burden of a shift from fossil fuels—while acknowledging that developing nations would be denied a certain amount of growth if they had to give up cheap energy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn November 4, 2016, the Paris agreement officially entered into force, just four days before Donald Trump would be elected president of the United States on a campaign promise to pull out of the agreement. And on June 1, 2017, Trump made good on that promise, saying that “the United States will withdraw from the Paris climate accord, but begin negotiations to reenter either the Paris accord or a really entirely new transaction on terms that are fair to the United States, its businesses, its workers, its people, its taxpayers.” Technically, the United States remains in the agreement until 2020, which is the earliest Trump can officially withdraw.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure class='AssetEmbedWrapper-eVDQiB byBkf asset-embed'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cpicture class='ResponsiveImagePicture-cWuUZO dUOtEa AssetEmbedResponsiveAsset-cXBNxi lqMXz asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image'\u003e\u003cimg src='https://media.wired.com/photos/5a726e8cd107c842c752925b/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/whatsnext.jpg' alt='Climate Change The Complete WIRED Guide'\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eWhat\u0026#39;s Next for Climate Change\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe good news is, the global community is pretty united on the risks of climate change. The science is getting good enough to link specific extreme events—anomalous hurricanes, extreme flooding events—directly to human-caused climate change, and that’s making it easier to build a case for dramatic action to stem the damage. But what should those actions be?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe most obvious solution to climate change woes is a dramatic shift away from fossil fuels and toward renewable energies: solar, wind, geothermal, and (deep breath) nuclear. And we’re making solid progress, growing our renewable electricity generation about 2.8 percent every year worldwide.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe also must fix our fundamentally broken relationship with the land itself. In the summer of 2019, the IPCC  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/ipcc-land-report/' class='link'\u003ereleased a report\u003c/a\u003e  warning that by abusing land, we’re greatly exacerbating climate change. Destroying forests removes an important carbon sink—CO \u003csub\u003e2\u003c/sub\u003e  goes in and oxygen comes out. Not helping matters are the supercharged wildfires like California’s spewing all that captured carbon into the atmosphere. Skyrocketing demand for meat worldwide means more cows burping more methane: The global food system as a whole is responsible for a stunning  \u003ca href='%5Bhttps://www.wired.com/story/ipcc-land-report-food/%5D(https://www.wired.com/story/ipcc-land-report-food/)' class='link'\u003e37 percent of emissions\u003c/a\u003e . Making that system more efficient would put a huge dent in global greenhouse gas emissions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStill, there’s an increasing understanding that even if every country that originally signed up for the Paris agreement meets every single one of their stated goals, the Earth is still set to experience some dramatic changes. In certain ways, we\u0026#39;ve already passed  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/climate-tipping-point/' class='link'\u003etipping points\u003c/a\u003e : Even if we stopped emitting today, we\u0026#39;d still see dramatic effects. The greenhouse gases are already in the atmosphere, and we\u0026#39;re locked into a certain amount of warming. And that means we need to start preparing for a different kind of climate future—primarily, in the way we build. The floods will come, forcing us to make new rules governing building. An ever-lengthening wildfire season will discourage building along the wildland-urban interface. And people will stream in from regions made uninhabitable by drought or heat or flooding, forcing other countries to adapt their immigration policies to a new class of refugees.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eAll of those changes will cost money. That was one of the primary motivators for the Paris agreement: Switching away from cheap fossil fuels means that businesses and companies are going to need to take a financial hit to ensure a profitable, livable future. Which is why many of the solutions to climate change have nothing to do with climate science, per se: They have to do with economics.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003caside class='Sidebar-pgAgH kmwJca'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eBy the Numbers\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e407.6 parts per million\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe concentration of CO \u003csub\u003e2\u003c/sub\u003e  in the lowest layer of our planet’s atmosphere.

Yes, those utilities would pass those costs on to customers, but the fee the government charges would come back to households as a “carbon dividend.” As the fee increases year over year, polluters will pay more and more, and switch to renewable sources of energy to emit less and less. Countries like Canada and Sweden have already shown this kind of carbon tax to dramatically cut emissions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSocially conscious investors, for their part, are making a difference by holding businesses to account for their impacts on the climate—and the ways in which climate change will impact their business. Last year, a collective of small-scale pension systems forced Occidental Petroleum, one of the country’s largest oil companies, to disclose climate risk in its shareholder prospectus; ExxonMobil caved to pressure in December 2017. Places with large endowments, like universities, are facing political pressure to divest from the fossil fuel industry.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThese are all indirect ways of holding the fossil fuel industry accountable for the financial toll it takes on the Earth with every gigaton of greenhouse gases emitted. But there are more direct ways they can pay up, too. After reporting by  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eInside-Climate News\u003c/em\u003e  revealed in 2015 that ExxonMobil has long known about the risks of climate change, the company is being investigated by attorneys general in multiple states to determine if it violated consumer or investor protection statutes. The city of San Francisco is suing the five largest publicly-held producers of fossil fuels to get them to pay for infrastructure to protect against rising sea levels. New York City followed with a similar suit.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLet’s say those suits succeed, and at-risk cities get some help making the massive infrastructure updates necessary to protect their coastline investments. After doing everything we can to reduce further carbon emissions and protect life and property from the dangers of a changing climate, it still won’t be enough to keep global temperatures from rising beyond that 2-degree-Celsius tipping point. So that’s when humanity goes into proactive mode, potentially unleashing a controversial set of experimental technologies into the atmosphere. This is geoengineering: Removing carbon dioxide and reducing heat through, let’s say, *experimental* means. Like salt-spraying ships, and supersized space mirrors.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of the great hopes of the IPCC’s latest report is that we can pull carbon dioxide directly out of the atmosphere and store it underground through a process called bioenergy with carbon capture and storage. But that technology doesn’t exist yet. Another strategy attempts to reduce heat by injecting sulfate particles into the atmosphere, reflecting solar radiation back into space—but that could trigger too much global cooling. Put mildly, most of the propositions for geoengineering are underdeveloped. The drive to complete those ideas will depend on the success of global cutbacks in the decades to come.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class='AssetEmbedWrapper-eVDQiB byBkf asset-embed'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cpicture class='ResponsiveImagePicture-cWuUZO dUOtEa AssetEmbedResponsiveAsset-cXBNxi lqMXz asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image'\u003e\u003cimg src='https://media.wired.com/photos/5a728b04d8520d1deb145f56/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/learnmore.jpg' alt='Climate Change The Complete WIRED Guide'\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eLearn More\u003c/div\u003e\u003cul class='list-disc pl-5 space-y-2'\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/the-dirty-secret-of-the-worlds-plan-to-avert-climate-disaster/?mbid=GuidesLearnMore' class='link'\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eThe Dirty Secret of the World’s Plan to Avert Climate Disaster\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change issued its fifth assessment report in 2014, it laid out 116 scenarios for keeping average global temperature rise under 2 degrees Celsius.

Chesky reasoned that Airbnb would need to significantly strengthen its identity verification. He even thought he could get people to use the app as a credential, something as respected as a government-issued ID. If he could transform Airbnb into a storefront for real-world services, Chesky thought, he’d catapult his company from a nearly $10-billion-a-year business into one that boasted membership in tech’s pantheon.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eOver the next few days, Chesky spilled these thoughts into an Evernote document. “I was basically going from room to room just pouring out this stream-of-consciousness manifesto, like Jack Kerouac writing  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eOn the Road\u003c/em\u003e ,” he says, referring to the frenetically produced single roll of teletype paper that catalyzed the beat movement. “I dusted off all my ideas from 2012 to 2016,” Chesky tells me. “I basically said, ‘We’re not just a vacation app—we’re going to be a platform, a community.’” By Friday he had around 10,000 words, “incomprehensible to anyone but me.” He began to refine it, and by the time the weekend was over, Chesky had distilled his document down to 1,500 words.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure class='AssetEmbedWrapper-eVDQiB byBkf asset-embed'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cpicture class='ResponsiveImagePicture-cWuUZO dUOtEa AssetEmbedResponsiveAsset-cXBNxi lqMXz asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image'\u003e\u003cimg src='https://media.wired.com/photos/68229656ab4411c55efe0c38/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/2025_05_07_Chesky_-288x.jpg' alt='Brian Chesky on the couch with his dog surrounded by conceptual services.'\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003ePHOTOGRAPH: GABRIELA HASBUN\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter the holiday, Chesky gathered his leadership team into a conference room. He handed the team copies of his memo à la Jeff Bezos and waited as his direct reports took it in. “Usually when I share ideas, people aren’t bought in,” he says. “But this time, there wasn’t a lot of feedback. People were really excited. And two years later, that document will now be executed with an exacting detail to what I wrote.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis month, Airbnb will launch the first stage of its more than $200 million reinvention: a panoply of more than 10,000 vendors peddling a swath of services in 260 cities in 30 countries. It is also revitalizing an unsuccessful experiment the company began in 2016: offering bespoke local activities, or what it calls “experiences.” The next stage, launch date unspecified, involves making your profile on Airbnb so robust that it’s “almost like a passport,” as Chesky puts it. After that comes a deep immersion into AI: Inspired by his relationship with Altman, Chesky hopes to build the ultimate agent, a super-concierge who starts off handling customer service and eventually knows you well enough to plan your travel and maybe the rest of your life.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Brian’s been badly underrated as a tech CEO,” Altman says of his friend. “He\u0026#39;s not usually mentioned in the same breath as Larry Page or Bill Gates, but I think he is on a path to build as big of a company.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat’s a stretch—Airbnb is nowhere near the size of those oligarchic powers. But Chesky was feeling the need for big changes; While impressive, Airbnb’s growth rate doesn’t suggest that the company will soon reach the trillion-dollar heights of Google and Microsoft. “I’m 43 and at a crossroads, where I can either be almost done or just getting started,” he tells me. “There\u0026#39;s a scenario where I\u0026#39;m basically done. Airbnb is very profitable. We\u0026#39;ve kind of, mostly, nailed vacation rentals.

The relaunch was five weeks away. The second floor—where signs warn employees not to bring visitors—had become a sprawling eyes-only command center. The walls were covered with dozens of large poster boards, each one featuring a city, that read as if a group of McKinsey consultants had tackled a fourth-grade geography assignment. Austin, Texas, was written up as “a funky come-as-you-are kind of place” with a handful of “first principles,” one of which was “Outlaw of Texas,” with pointers to food trucks and vintage markets. Another so-called principle was “Live and Alive,” referring to music venues and bat watching; a third was “Dam Lakes,” referring to various water sports. Other blindingly obvious notations included barbeque, tacos, and the two-step. The Paris poster painted a “revolutionary” city marked by slow living and enduring culture.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eChesky strode up and greeted me enthusiastically. Dressed in a slim T-shirt that exposed his swole physique, he bounced on his heels with a jittery energy that reminded me of the first time I met him, in January 2009. He had just joined Y Combinator’s famous program for startups, and he and his classmates were at a party at the home of YC cofounder Paul Graham. (Graham told me then that he thought Airbnb’s business plan was crazy but was impressed by their determination.) I mentioned to Chesky that I was headed to Washington, DC, for Barack Obama’s inauguration, and he and his cofounders immediately tried to convince me to use their service to sleep on someone’s couch. I declined, but somehow over the next 15 years they managed to sell the idea to 2 billion people, including me, and now the company has a market cap worth more than Marriott.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eChesky ushers me into a conference room to get a preview of the new Airbnb app. His engineers and designers have rebuilt the app from scratch, and he waves around a stick of lip balm as a talisman as he talks me through the redesign. Also in the room is his product marketing head, Jud Coplan, while his vice president of design, Teo Connor, Zooms in from London. While customers likely think of Airbnb as a travel company, its leaders view the operation as an achievement in design. Which makes sense; both Chesky and his cofounder Joe Gebbia were students at the Rhode Island School of Design.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class='AssetEmbedWrapper-eVDQiB byBkf asset-embed'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cpicture class='ResponsiveImagePicture-cWuUZO dUOtEa AssetEmbedResponsiveAsset-cXBNxi lqMXz asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image'\u003e\u003cimg src='https://media.wired.com/photos/68229a00da22f016faf70ab6/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/All-new-app---Summer-Release-2025---US.jpg' alt='A look at the new Airbnb Interface'\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAirbnb\u0026#39;s new user interface featuring experiences and services.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003eCOURTESY OF AIRBNB\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eChesky explains that historically, people used Airbnb only once or twice a year, so its design had to be exceptionally simple. Now the company is retooling for more frequent access. Open the app, and you see a trio of icons that act as gateways to the expanded functions. Within minutes Chesky and his lieutenants are applauding the cheery, retro style of the icons—a house for traditional rentals, a hotel bell for services, and a Jules Verne-ish hot-air balloon representing activities. “We really thought deeply about the metaphor—what was the right visual to express an experience?” says Connor. Once they decided on the balloon, they drilled into how much fire should belch from the basket. The icons were drawn by a former Apple designer whose name Chesky would not divulge. “He’s a bit of a secret weapon,” he says.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA less-secret weapon is Chesky’s collaboration with the iconic, also ex-Apple, industrial designer Jony Ive. Chesky’s north star, it should be said, is Apple. “Steve Jobs, to me, is like Michelangelo or da Vinci,” he says. Despite never meeting Jobs, “I feel like I know him deeply, professionally, in a way that few people ever did, in a way that you only possibly could by starting a tech company as a creative person and going on a rocket ship,” Chesky says. By hiring Ive’s LoveFrom company and working with Jobs’ key collaborator, Chesky gets a taste of the famous Jobs/Ive dynamic. Ive himself doesn’t make that comparison, but he does praise Chesky’s design chops. “There are certain tactical things where I hope that sometimes I\u0026#39;m of use to Brian, just as as a fellow designer,” Ive says. “But the majority of our work has been around ideas and the way we frame problems and understand opportunities.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother key part of the app is the profile page. “You need trust,” Chesky says—meaning a verifiable identity. Airbnb has been vetting the new vendors, which it calls “service hosts.” For months, Chesky says, an army of background researchers has been scrutinizing the résumés, licenses, and recommendations of chefs, photographers, manicurists, masseuses, hair stylists, makeup artists, personal trainers, and aestheticians who provide spa treatments such as facials and microdermabrasions. They’re all being professionally photographed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure class='AssetEmbedWrapper-eVDQiB byBkf asset-embed'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cpicture class='ResponsiveImagePicture-cWuUZO dUOtEa AssetEmbedResponsiveAsset-cXBNxi lqMXz asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image'\u003e\u003cimg src='https://media.wired.com/photos/682295579daeadf2392f9b19/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/WIRED_Guest-profile---Summer-Release-2025---US.jpg' alt='An image of a new Airbnb guest profile'\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAirbnb\u0026#39;s new guest profile interface.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003eCOURTESY OF AIRBNB\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor the next phase—turning Airbnb’s user profiles into a primary internet ID—Connor and her team have engaged in some far-out experimentation. She rattles off a list of technologies they’ve been exploring, including biometrics, holograms, and the reactive inks used to deter counterfeiting on official ID cards. But it’s far from easy to become a private identity utility (hello, Facebook), and even Chesky notes that getting governments to accept an Airbnb credential to verify identity is “a stretch goal.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow that a whole slew of people will have new reasons to chat with each other and coordinate plans, Airbnb has also enhanced its messaging functions. Fellow travelers who share experiences can form communities, stay in touch, even share videos and photos. “I don’t know if I want to call it a social network, because of the stigma associated with it,” says Ari Balogh, Airbnb’s CTO. So they employ a fuzzier term. “We think of it as a connection platform,” he says. “You’re going to see us build a lot more stuff on top of it, although we’re not an advertising system, thank goodness.” (My own observation is that any for-profit company that can host advertising will, but whatever.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis brings us to the services—the heart and soul of this reinvention. Those now on offer seem designed to augment an Airbnb stay with all the stuff that drives up your bill at a luxury resort, like a DIY White Lotus. It will be interesting to see how the company handles the inevitable cases of food poisoning or bad haircuts (and skeezy customers), but Airbnb can draw on its 17 years of experience with dirty sheets, all-night discos on the ground floor, or a host who is literally terrorizing you. Eventually, Chesky says, Airbnb will offer “hundreds” of services, perhaps as far-ranging as plumbing, cleaning, car repair, guitar lessons, and tutoring, and then take its 15 percent fee.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure class='AssetEmbedWrapper-eVDQiB byBkf asset-embed callout--group-item callout--group-item-1'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cpicture class='ResponsiveImagePicture-cWuUZO dUOtEa AssetEmbedResponsiveAsset-cXBNxi lqMXz asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image'\u003e\u003cimg src='https://media.wired.com/photos/6822972b9049547eae0a5ea2/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Crafted%2520cuts%2520by%2520Bryan%2520-%2520Chicago%2C%2520Illinois%2520-%25202025%2520Summer%2520Release%2520-%2520Credit%2520%255BLyndon%2520French%255D%2520.jpg' alt='A barber is shaving a man's beard'\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003eCrafted cuts by Bryan, Chicago, Illinois\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003eCOURTESY OF AIRBNB; LYNDON FRENCH\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cfigure class='AssetEmbedWrapper-eVDQiB byBkf asset-embed callout--group-item callout--group-item-2'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cpicture class='ResponsiveImagePicture-cWuUZO dUOtEa AssetEmbedResponsiveAsset-cXBNxi lqMXz asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image'\u003e\u003cimg src='https://media.wired.com/photos/6822972d47675d5731b32875/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Train%2520with%2520Steve%2520Jordan%2C%2520Trainer%2520To%2520The%2520Stars%2520-%2520Los%2520Angeles%2C%2520California%2520-%25202025%2520Summer%2520Release%2520-%2520Credit%2520%255BJackie%2520Beale%255D.jpg' alt='A trainer works with a man at the gym'\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003eTrain with Steve Jordan, Trainer to the Stars, Los Angeles, California\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003eCOURTESY OF AIRBNB; JACKIE BEALE\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe other key feature of the company’s reinvention, of course, is Experiences.

Chesky’s excuses include tactical errors: After a big initial splash, the company didn’t follow up with more marketing, and it didn’t establish a strong flow of new experiences. But the big reason, he says, was that it was too early. Now the company has five times as many customers and an ecosystem to support the effort. “It was like our Newton,” says Chesky, referring to Apple’s handheld device that predated the iPhone. (Another Apple reference, for those keeping score.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eChesky’s crew has arranged for more than 22,000 experiences in 650 cities, including a smattering of so-called “originals,” with people at the top of their field—star athletes, Michelin chefs, famous celebrities. In the pipeline is Conan O’Brien selling a perch behind a mic in his podcast studio. (Don’t expect it to air.) Taking a lesson from his earlier flop, Chesky has planned a steady cadence of these short-term promotional stunts, which, of course, is what the Conan experience ultimately is. “We’re going to have thousands of originals and maybe one day hundreds of thousands—a regular drumbeat of some of the biggest iconic celebrities,” Chesky says.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe shows me how someone could take a trip to, say, Mexico City and book experiences instantly. “Fun fact—I’ve always dreamed of being a professional wrestler in Mexico.

But then, in 2011, the company had its first real crisis when a host publicly shared a horror story about how an Airbnb guest from deep, deep hell pillaged and trashed her home. What wasn’t stolen—the customer broke into a locked closet to grab a passport, cash, and heirloom jewelry—was ravaged and burned in the fireplace. “The death-like smell from the bathroom was frightening,” wrote the host. The story threatened to destroy the cheerful person-to-person vibe the company had cultivated. It didn’t help that Airbnb’s initial response was clueless and weak.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eChesky stepped up to become the face of the company and instituted overdue safety protocols. Over the next few years, Chesky cemented his alpha status. In 2022 his cofounder Joe Gebbia stepped down from daily duties, though he still sits on the board. (Recently Gebbia has been in the news for his very public participation in DOGE’s remaking of the US government. When asked about it at a Q and A session with employees, Chesky said that Gebbia was free to have his own opinions, but they are not the company’s. Chesky did not attend Trump’s inauguration.) The third cofounder, Nathan Blecharczyk, is still with the company, though it’s notable that as I sat in meetings with over a dozen executives, the only time his name came up was when I mentioned it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eChesky was totally in charge during the pandemic, when Airbnb lost 80 percent of its business in eight weeks. He laid off a quarter of the staff. Now that bookings surpass pre-2020 levels, he thinks the company is stronger. And he learned a big lesson: “The pandemic was the turning point of the company,” he says. “My first principle became ‘Don’t apologize for how you want to run your company.’ Most of all you should not apologize for being in the details. The number one thing people want to do is keep you out of the details.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen Chesky shared some of these views at a Y Combinator event in 2024, Paul Graham was inspired to  \u003ca href='https://www.paulgraham.com/foundermode.html' class='link'\u003ewrite an essay\u003c/a\u003e  called “ \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/plaintext-want-to-get-into-founder-mode-you-should-be-so-lucky/' class='link'\u003eFounder Mode\u003c/a\u003e .” Graham used Chesky’s story to argue that only the person who created a company knows what is best, and the worst mistake is to listen to management types who haven’t built their own. The essay struck a nerve; people were stopping Chesky on the street and yelling “Founder mode!” Someone dropped off a baseball hat for him with those words; it now sits on a shelf in his conference room.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eChesky, meanwhile, has been deep in the details, especially on this reinvention, itself kind of a classic founder move. “I did review work before the pandemic, but people kind of hated it. There were negative associations to a CEO reviewing everything; it’s considered micromanaging.” Also, his idol Steve Jobs was famous—infamous?—for his unsparing criticism. Chesky contends that once he went all-in on dishing out criticism, with no sheepishness, people seemed happier. But even if they weren’t, he’d do it anyway. Curious to see how this worked, I arranged to attend a Chesky review.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGathered in a conference room, the design and engineering teams presented near-final app tweaks affecting how hosts set up their services. Chesky seemed fairly pleased with what he was seeing—so much so that he apologized to me afterward that I didn’t get to see him go animal with his underlings. Nonetheless, even during this lovefest of a product review, Chesky babbled a constant stream of minor corrections.  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eThe cursor is oddly centered … Those visual cues are a little confusing … We need a subtle drop shadow here … The next line doesn’t seem centered vertically … That address input is pretty awkward … That button looks oddly short, is it supposed to be that short? … That shimmer, do we think we need it?

But when I meet Chesky a day later to sum things up, he tells me that I’d just missed a spicier product review. Then he gets serious, explaining what the reinvention means to him. “I felt a little bit like the vacation rental guy,” he says. “Like we as a company are a little underestimated.” He brings up Apple again, saying that both companies embody the idea that a business relationship can generate emotion. “My ambition is kind of like the ambition of an artist and designer,” he says.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt that point Chesky gets a little woo. “Magic, in hindsight, is not technology,” he says as he reflects on Apple’s wizardry. What he’s realized is that magic lies in forging connections with those who offer you a bed, a microdermabrasion, a sparring match in a lucha libre ring. “The magic that is timeless is, like, the stuff you remember at the end of your life.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe lets that sit for a minute. Then he puts a cap on that insight, sounding less like a CEO than a life coach. “I’ve never had a dream with a device in it,” he says. Leave it to the subconscious to highlight what matters. That said, his  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eday\u003c/em\u003e  dreams certainly involve a new kind of device. In his off hours he’s helping with a secret project headed by his friends Altman and Ive to create a device that Altman says is the next step beyond computers. (“This is not theoretical memo-swapping,” Altman tells me. “We’re hard at work on it, prototyping.”)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut that’s somewhere off in the future. In the realm of products that actually exist in the world, Chesky will have to face competition from dozens of domain leaders including Yelp, Instacart, DoorDash, Ticketmaster, Hotels.com, Tinder, OpenTable, and Craigslist, to name but a few. You can probably add Apple, Meta, and Microsoft, since Chesky wants Airbnb to be a universal credential and what certainly looks like a social network. Even Steve Jobs might have blinked at taking on that crowd all at once.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem class='italic'\u003eCorrection: 5/14/2025, 3:10 pm EDT: The article has been corrected to reflect the year Joe Gebbia stepped down from daily duties.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003chr class='my-4 border-t border-gray-300'\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem class='italic'\u003eImages styled by Jillian Knox.\u003c/em\u003e  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eFeaturing: Liv Skinner, Liv Well and Francesca Lopez, Zinnia Wildflower Bakehouse\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem class='italic'\u003eLet us know what you think about this article.

Fox Foundation announced a momentous scientific breakthrough—the discovery of a biomarker for PD. It meant that, for the first time ever, we can now pinpoint the earliest known signs of the disease in Parkinson’s patients.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis long-awaited new procedure is called the “alpha-synuclein seeding amplification assay” (SAA), and it’s capable of detecting the misfolded alpha-synuclein in spinal fluid—the wayward protein clearly linked to Parkinson’s. It separates, with a stunning 90 percent specificity, those who have evidence of PD pathology in their cells from those who do not. It does so even before the emergence of symptoms, much like the way high blood pressure or cholesterol levels are used to detect cardiovascular risk long before a heart attack lands someone in the ER.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt would be hard to overstate the implications of this development for people living with dysfunction in their alpha-synuclein. For one thing, we’ve never had a way to know who these people are—that is, until the moment of diagnosis, by which point ongoing damage to brain cells is already well underway. As for the diagnosis itself, which for most people comes as a bolt from the blue, it has always been frustratingly subjective and essentially based on a physician’s opinion following a brief once-over in the doctor’s office—not very useful for medical care provision, let alone biomedical drug development.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003caside class='Sidebar-pgAgH kmwJca'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eREAD MORE\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis story is from the  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/wired-world' class='link'\u003eWIRED World in 2024\u003c/a\u003e , our annual trends briefing.

For biopharma firms weighing a decision to enter or stay in the high-risk neurological disease space, this changes the value proposition of investment on its face. In 2024, we will see a ramp-up of potential new drugs entering the pipeline and progressing along their path toward pharmacy shelves.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat’s just as remarkable is how the SAA breakthrough was arrived at. The search for the biomarker required finding and studying “needles in a haystack”: people without any traditional symptoms of PD and unwittingly living with increased risk for the disease. It was critical to figure out what biology set them apart from those who don’t get Parkinson’s. But how do you find someone who doesn’t know they’re being looked for?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs it turns out, your sense of smell is a surprisingly good predictor of brain disease. (We’re talking here not about the short-term smell loss associated with Covid-19, but significant and enduring smell loss that persists over years.) For a while now, researchers have known about the link between smell loss and neurodegeneration, especially in the presence of certain other risk factors, such as a diagnosis with REM behavior disorder (RBD), a sleep disorder. Research shows that half of those over age 60 are living with some degree of smell loss, yet the majority don’t realize it until they’re tested. If you couple this with the fact that all major brain diseases—Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, ALS, Huntington’s—are associated with some amount of smell loss, this is astounding.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Michael J. Fox Foundation’s large-scale observational study of Parkinson’s set out to use poor smell as one of its criteria for finding and enrolling at-risk individuals. (We should note that, for this risk group, it’s still unclear  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eif\u003c/em\u003e  or  \u003cem class='italic'\u003ewhen\u003c/em\u003e  the disease may eventually show up.)

But now we can report that the test accurately diagnosed disease in 99 percent of people with poor smell and so-called sporadic Parkinson’s (in other words, those with no genetic mutation).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn 2024, we will begin to see a sea change in the possibilities around screening for and predicting PD and, very possibly, other diseases of aging. An annual scratch-and-sniff test may soon become as commonplace as your mammogram or colonoscopy.

Some researchers have welcomed the idea as part of a grand narrative about fundamental laws of nature. They argue that the basic laws of physics are not “complete” in the sense of supplying all we need to comprehend natural phenomena; rather, evolution—biological or otherwise—introduces functions and novelties that could not even in principle be predicted from physics alone. “I’m so glad they’ve done what they’ve done,” said Stuart Kauffman, an emeritus complexity theorist at the University of Pennsylvania. “They’ve made these questions legitimate.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cfigure class='AssetEmbedWrapper-eVDQiB byBkf asset-embed'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cpicture class='ResponsiveImagePicture-cWuUZO dUOtEa AssetEmbedResponsiveAsset-cXBNxi lqMXz asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image'\u003e\u003cimg src='https://media.wired.com/photos/683ebea7de4a68cffaedeeb7/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/MichaelWong_coMichaelWong.jpeg' alt='Image may contain Marcel Hirscher Black Hair Hair Person Head Adult Face Dimples Happy and Smile'\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cp\u003eMichael Wong, an astrobiologist at the Carnegie Institution in Washington, DC.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003ePhotograph: Katherine Cain/Carnegie Science\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eOthers argue that extending evolutionary ideas about function to non-living systems is an overreach.

The theory of Darwinian evolution by natural selection helps us to understand how living things have changed in the past.

Szostak—who six years later would get a Nobel Prize for unrelated work—wanted to quantify the amount of information or complexity that biological molecules like proteins or DNA strands embody. Classical information theory, developed by the telecommunications researcher Claude Shannon in the 1940s and later elaborated by the Russian mathematician Andrey Kolmogorov, offers one answer. Per Kolmogorov, the complexity of a string of symbols (such as binary 1s and 0s) depends on how concisely one can specify that sequence uniquely.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor example, consider DNA, which is a chain of four different building blocks called nucleotides. Α strand composed only of one nucleotide, repeating again and again, has much less complexity—and, by extension, encodes less information—than one composed of all four nucleotides in which the sequence seems random (as is more typical in the genome).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class='AssetEmbedWrapper-eVDQiB byBkf asset-embed'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cpicture class='ResponsiveImagePicture-cWuUZO dUOtEa AssetEmbedResponsiveAsset-cXBNxi lqMXz asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image'\u003e\u003cimg src='https://media.wired.com/photos/683ebef15b130ef3fd1d1261/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/JackSzostak_crHHMI.jpeg' alt='Image may contain Jack Szostak Face Head Person Photography Portrait Adult Accessories Glasses and Senior Citizen'\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cp\u003eJack Szostak proposed a way to quantify information in biological systems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003ePhotograph:  HHMI\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut Szostak pointed out that Kolmogorov’s measure of complexity neglects an issue crucial to biology: how biological molecules function.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn biology, sometimes many different molecules can do the same job.

He made a bunch of RNA aptamers and used chemical methods to identify and isolate the ones that would bind to a chosen target molecule. He then mutated the winners a little to seek even better binders and repeated the process. The better an aptamer gets at binding, the less likely it is that another RNA molecule chosen at random will do just as well: The functional information of the winners in each round should rise. Szostak found that the functional information of the best-performing aptamers got ever closer to the maximum value predicted theoretically.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 class='text-xl font-semibold'\u003eSelected for Function\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eHazen came across Szostak’s idea while thinking about the origin of life—an issue that drew him in as a mineralogist, because chemical reactions taking place on minerals have long been suspected to have played a key role in getting life started. “I concluded that talking about life versus nonlife is a false dichotomy,” Hazen said. “I felt there had to be some kind of continuum—there has to be something that’s driving this process from simpler to more complex systems.” Functional information, he thought, promised a way to get at the “increasing complexity of all kinds of evolving systems.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn 2007 Hazen collaborated with Szostak to write a  \u003ca href='https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0701744104' class='link'\u003ecomputer simulation\u003c/a\u003e  involving algorithms that evolve via mutations. Their function, in this case, was not to bind to a target molecule, but to carry out computations. Again they found that the functional information increased spontaneously over time as the system evolved.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere the idea languished for years. Hazen could not see how to take it any further until Wong accepted a fellowship at the Carnegie Institution in 2021. Wong had a background in planetary atmospheres, but he and Hazen discovered they were thinking about the same questions. “From the very first moment that we sat down and talked about ideas, it was unbelievable,” Hazen said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class='AssetEmbedWrapper-eVDQiB byBkf asset-embed'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cpicture class='ResponsiveImagePicture-cWuUZO dUOtEa AssetEmbedResponsiveAsset-cXBNxi lqMXz asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image'\u003e\u003cimg src='https://media.wired.com/photos/683ebf97fb22488f9e1a0627/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/RobertHazen_crcoRobertHazen_DeepCarbonObservatory.jpeg' alt='Image may contain Face Head Person Photography Portrait Adult Happy and Smile'\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cp\u003eRobert Hazen, a mineralogist at the Carnegie Institution in Washington, DC.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003ePhotograph: Courtesy of Robert Hazen\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e“I had got disillusioned with the state of the art of looking for life on other worlds,” Wong said. “I thought it was too narrowly constrained to life as we know it here on Earth, but life elsewhere may take a completely different evolutionary trajectory. So how do we abstract far enough away from life on Earth that we’d be able to notice life elsewhere even if it had different chemical specifics, but not so far that we’d be including all kinds of self-organizing structures like hurricanes?”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe pair soon realized that they needed expertise from a whole other set of disciplines. “We needed people who came at this problem from very different points of view, so that we all had checks and balances on each other’s prejudices,” Hazen said. “This is not a mineralogical problem; it’s not a physics problem, or a philosophical problem. It’s all of those things.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThey suspected that functional information was the key to understanding how complex systems like living organisms arise through evolutionary processes happening over time. “We all assumed the second law of thermodynamics supplies the arrow of time,” Hazen said. “But it seems like there’s a much more idiosyncratic pathway that the universe takes. We think it’s because of selection for function—a very orderly process that leads to ordered states. That’s not part of the second law, although it’s not inconsistent with it either.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLooked at this way, the concept of functional information allowed the team to think about the development of complex systems that don’t seem related to life at all.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt first glance, it doesn’t seem a promising idea. In biology, function makes sense. But what does “function” mean for a rock?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAll it really implies, Hazen said, is that some selective process favors one entity over lots of other potential combinations. A huge number of different minerals can form from silicon, oxygen, aluminum, calcium, and so on. But only a few are found in any given environment. The most stable minerals turn out to be the most common. But sometimes less stable minerals persist because there isn’t enough energy available to convert them to more stable phases.\u003c/p\u003e\u003caside class='PullQuoteEmbedWrapper-sc-EoVjf kgVYDs'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Information itself might be a vital parameter of the cosmos, similar to mass, charge, and energy.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003eMichael Wong, Carnegie Institution\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis might seem trivial, like saying that some objects exist while other ones don’t, even if they could in theory.

Minerals evolve toward greater complexity (though not in the Darwinian sense). Hazen and colleagues speculate that complex forms of carbon such as graphene might form in the hydrocarbon-rich environment of Saturn’s moon Titan—another example of an increase in functional information that doesn’t involve life.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s the same with chemical elements. The first moments after the Big Bang were filled with undifferentiated energy. As things cooled, quarks formed and then condensed into protons and neutrons. These gathered into the nuclei of hydrogen, helium, and lithium atoms. Only once stars formed and nuclear fusion happened within them did more complex elements like carbon and oxygen form. And only when some stars had exhausted their fusion fuel did their collapse and explosion in supernovas create heavier elements such as heavy metals.

Sometimes it would happen in sudden jumps. That echoes what is seen in biological evolution. Biologists have long recognized transitions where the complexity of organisms increases abruptly. One such transition was the appearance of organisms with cellular nuclei (around 1.8 billion to 2.7 billion years ago). Then there was the transition to multicellular organisms (around 2 billion to 1.6 billion years ago), the abrupt diversification of body forms in the Cambrian explosion (540 million years ago), and the appearance of central nervous systems (around 600 million to 520 million years ago). The arrival of humans was arguably another major and rapid evolutionary transition.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEvolutionary biologists have tended to view each of these transitions as a contingent event. But within the functional-information framework, it seems possible that such jumps in evolutionary processes (whether biological or not) are inevitable.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn these jumps, Wong pictures the evolving objects as accessing an entirely new landscape of possibilities and ways to become organized, as if penetrating to the “next floor up.” Crucially, what matters—the criteria for selection, on which continued evolution depends—also changes, plotting a wholly novel course. On the next floor up, possibilities await that could not have been guessed before you reached it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor example, during the origin of life it might initially have mattered that proto-biological molecules would persist for a long time—that they’d be stable. But once such molecules became organized into groups that could catalyze one another’s formation—what Kauffman has called autocatalytic cycles—the molecules themselves could be short-lived, so long as the cycles persisted. Now it was dynamical, not thermodynamic, stability that mattered. Ricard Solé of the Santa Fe Institute thinks such jumps might be equivalent to phase transitions in physics, such as the freezing of water or the magnetization of iron: They are collective processes with universal features, and they mean that everything changes, everywhere, all at once. In other words, in this view there’s a kind of physics of evolution—and it’s a kind of physics we know about already.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 class='text-xl font-semibold'\u003eThe Biosphere Creates Its Own Possibilities\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe tricky thing about functional information is that, unlike a measure such as size or mass, it is contextual: It depends on what we want the object to do, and what environment it is in. For instance, the functional information for an RNA aptamer binding to a particular molecule will generally be quite different from the information for binding to a different molecule.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYet finding new uses for existing components is precisely what evolution does. Feathers did not evolve for flight, for example. This repurposing reflects how biological evolution is jerry-rigged, making use of what’s available.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eKauffman argues that biological evolution is thus constantly creating not just new types of organisms but new possibilities for organisms, ones that not only did not exist at an earlier stage of evolution but could not possibly have existed. From the soup of single-celled organisms that constituted life on Earth 3 billion years ago, no elephant could have suddenly emerged—this required a whole host of preceding, contingent but specific innovations.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, there is no theoretical limit to the number of uses an object has. This means that the appearance of new functions in evolution can’t be predicted—and yet some new functions can dictate the very rules of how the system evolves subsequently. “The biosphere is creating its own possibilities,” Kauffman said. “Not only do we not know what will happen, we don’t even know what can happen.” Photosynthesis was such a profound development; so were eukaryotes, nervous systems and language. As the microbiologist Carl Woese and the physicist Nigel Goldenfeld put it in 2011, “We need an additional set of rules describing the evolution of the original rules. But this upper level of rules itself needs to evolve. Thus, we end up with an infinite hierarchy.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe physicist Paul Davies of Arizona State University agrees that biological evolution “generates its own extended possibility space which cannot be reliably predicted or captured via any deterministic process from prior states.

Davies and his co-workers have recently  \u003ca href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12029' class='link'\u003esuggested\u003c/a\u003e  that evolution in an expanding accessible phase space might be formally equivalent to the “ \u003ca href='https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-godels-proof-works-20200714/' class='link'\u003eincompleteness theorems\u003c/a\u003e ” devised by the mathematician Kurt Gödel. Gödel showed that any system of axioms in mathematics permits the formulation of statements that can’t be shown to be true or false. We can only decide such statements by adding new axioms.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDavies and colleagues say that, as with Gödel’s theorem, the key factor that makes biological evolution open-ended and prevents us from being able to express it in a self-contained and all-encompassing phase space is that it is self-referential: The appearance of new actors in the space feeds back on those already there to create new possibilities for action. This isn’t the case for physical systems, which, even if they have, say, millions of stars in a galaxy, are not self-referential.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“An increase in complexity provides the future potential to find new strategies unavailable to simpler organisms,” said Marcus Heisler, a plant developmental biologist at the University of Sydney and co-author of the incompleteness paper. This connection between biological evolution and the issue of noncomputability, Davies said, “goes right to the heart of what makes life so magical.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIs biology special, then, among evolutionary processes in having an open-endedness generated by self-reference? Hazen thinks that in fact once complex cognition is added to the mix—once the components of the system can reason, choose, and run experiments “in their heads”—the potential for macro-micro feedback and open-ended growth is even greater. “Technological applications take us way beyond Darwinism,” he said. A watch gets made faster if the watchmaker is not blind.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 class='text-xl font-semibold'\u003eBack to the Bench\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf Hazen and colleagues are right that evolution involving any kind of selection inevitably increases functional information—in effect, complexity—does this mean that life itself, and perhaps consciousness and higher intelligence, is inevitable in the universe? That would run counter to what some biologists have thought. The eminent evolutionary biologist Ernst Mayr believed that the search for extraterrestrial intelligence was doomed because the appearance of humanlike intelligence is “utterly improbable.” After all, he said, if intelligence at a level that leads to cultures and civilizations were so adaptively useful in Darwinian evolution, how come it only arose once across the entire tree of life?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMayr’s evolutionary point possibly vanishes in the jump to humanlike complexity and intelligence, whereupon the whole playing field is utterly transformed.

In place of functional information, assembly theory relies on a number called the assembly index, which measures the minimum number of steps required to make an object from its constituent ingredients.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Laws for living systems must be somewhat different than what we have in physics now,” Walker said, “but that does not mean that there are no laws.” But she doubts that the putative law of functional information can be rigorously tested in the lab. “I am not sure how one could say [the theory] is right or wrong, since there is no way to test it objectively,” she said. “What would the experiment look for? How would it be controlled? I would love to see an example, but I remain skeptical until some metrology is done in this area.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHazen acknowledges that, for most physical objects, it is impossible to calculate functional information even in principle. Even for a single living cell, he admits, there’s no way of quantifying it. But he argues that this is not a sticking point, because we can still understand it conceptually and get an approximate quantitative sense of it. Similarly, we can’t calculate the exact dynamics of the asteroid belt because the gravitational problem is too complicated—but we can still describe it approximately enough to navigate spacecraft through it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWong sees a potential application of their ideas in astrobiology. One of the curious aspects of living organisms on Earth is that they tend to make a far smaller subset of organic molecules than they could make given the basic ingredients. That’s because natural selection has picked out some favored compounds. There’s much more glucose in living cells, for example, than you’d expect if molecules were simply being made either randomly or according to their thermodynamic stability. So one potential signature of lifelike entities on other worlds might be similar signs of selection outside what chemical thermodynamics or kinetics alone would generate. (Assembly theory similarly predicts complexity-based biosignatures.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere might be other ways of putting the ideas to the test. Wong said there is more work still to be done on mineral evolution, and they hope to look at nucleosynthesis and computational “artificial life.” Hazen also sees possible applications in oncology, soil science and language evolution. For example, the evolutionary biologist Frédéric Thomas of the University of Montpellier in France and colleagues  \u003ca href='https://academic.oup.com/emph/article/12/1/172/7761977' class='link'\u003ehave argued\u003c/a\u003e  that the selective principles governing the way cancer cells change over time in tumors are not like those of Darwinian evolution, in which the selection criterion is fitness, but more closely resemble the idea of selection for function from Hazen and colleagues.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHazen’s team has been fielding queries from researchers ranging from economists to neuroscientists, who are keen to see if the approach can help. “People are approaching us because they are desperate to find a model to explain their system,” Hazen said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut whether or not functional information turns out to be the right tool for thinking about these questions, many researchers seem to be converging on similar questions about complexity, information, evolution (both biological and cosmic), function and purpose, and the directionality of time. It’s hard not to suspect that something big is afoot. There are echoes of the early days of thermodynamics, which began with humble questions about how machines work and ended up speaking to the arrow of time, the peculiarities of living matter, and the fate of the universe.\u003c/p\u003e\u003chr class='my-4 border-t border-gray-300'\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem class='italic'\u003e\u003ca href='https://www.quantamagazine.org/why-everything-in-the-universe-turns-more-complex-20250402/' class='link'\u003eOriginal story\u003c/a\u003e reprinted with permission from \u003ca href='https://www.quantamagazine.org' class='link'\u003eQuanta Magazine\u003c/a\u003e, an editorially independent publication of the \u003ca href='https://www.simonsfoundation.org' class='link'\u003eSimons Foundation\u003c/a\u003e whose mission is to enhance public understanding of science by covering research developments and trends in mathematics and the physical and life sciences.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","publishedAt":"2025-06-08T11:00:00Z","categories":["Science","Complexity Theory"],"keywords":["Quanta Magazine, space, science, Jupiter, volcanoes, NASA, satellite images","Climate Desk, science, environment, Energy, wildfires, California","physics, Energy, Dot Physics, thermodynamics","science, space, China, Spacecraft, Asteroids","science, 23andMe, genetics, data privacy, biotech, ancestry, congress","science, Energy, environment, EPA, Policy","science, space, artificial intelligence, black holes","science, artificial intelligence, Policy, Donald Trump, Energy","science, health, crowd control, protests","mental health, pharmaceutical industry, medicine, depression, healthcare","science, health, COVID-19, coronavirus, public health, infectious disease","Quanta Magazine, science, space, complexity, Evolution"]},{"title":"A Researcher Figured Out How to Reveal Any Phone Number Linked to a Google Account","description":"Phone numbers are a gold mine for SIM swappers.

The idea of immersing ourselves in 3D environments dates all the way back to the stereoscopes that captivated people\u0026#39;s imaginations in the 19th century.

Nonetheless, it was the first \u0026#34;head-mounted display\u0026#34;; users who had its twin screens attached to their head could look around the room and see a virtual 3D cube hovering in midair. (Because you could also see your real-world surroundings, this was more like AR than VR, but it remains the inspiration for both technologies.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eSutherland and his colleague David Evans eventually joined the private sector, adapting their work to flight simulator products. The Air Force and NASA were both actively researching head-mounted displays as well, leading to massive helmets that could envelop pilots and astronauts in the illusion of 360-degree space. Inside the helmets, pilots could see a digital simulation of the world outside their plane, with their instruments superimposed in 3D over the display; when they moved their heads the display would shift, reflecting whatever part of the world they were \u0026#34;looking\u0026#34; at.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNone of this technology had a true name, though—at least not until the 1980s, when a twenty-something college dropout named Jaron Lanier dubbed it \u0026#34;virtual reality.\u0026#34; (The phrase was first used by French playwright Antonio Artaud in a 1933 essay.) The company Lanier cofounded, VPL Research, created the first official products that could deliver VR: the EyePhone (yup), the DataGlove, and the DataSuit. They delivered a compelling, if graphically primitive, experience, but they were slow, uncomfortable, and—at more than $350,000 for a full setup for two people, including the computer to run it all—prohibitively expensive.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYet, led by VPL’s promise and fueled by sci-fi writers, VR captured the popular imagination in the first half of the 1990s. If you didn\u0026#39;t read Neal Stephenson\u0026#39;s 1992 novel  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eSnow Crash\u003c/em\u003e , you may have seen the movie  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eLawnmower Man\u003c/em\u003e  that same year—a divine piece of schlock that featured VPL\u0026#39;s gear (and was so far removed from the Stephen King short story it purported to adapt that King sued to have his name removed from the poster). It wasn\u0026#39;t just colonizing genre movies or speculative fiction: VR figured prominently in syndicated live-action kiddie fare like  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eVR Troopers\u003c/em\u003e , and even popped up in episodes of  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eMurder She Wrote\u003c/em\u003e  and  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eMad About You\u003c/em\u003e .\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the real world, virtual reality was promised to gamers everywhere. In arcades and malls, Virtuality pods let people play short VR games (remember  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eDactyl Nightmare\u003c/em\u003e ?); in living rooms, Nintendo called its 3D videogame system \u0026#34;Virtual Boy,\u0026#34; conveniently ignoring the fact that the headsets delivered headaches rather than actual VR. (The Virtual Boy was discontinued six months after release.) VR proved unable to deliver on its promise, and its cultural presence eventually dried up. Research continued in academia and private-sector labs, but VR simply ceased to exist as a viable consumer technology.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen the smartphone came along.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePhones featured compact high-resolution displays; they contained tiny gyroscopes and accelerometers; they boasted mobile processors that could handle 3D graphics. And all of a sudden, the hardware limitations that stood in the way of VR weren\u0026#39;t a problem anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn 2012, id Software cofounder and virtual-reality aficionado, John Carmack, came to the E3 videogame trade show with a special surprise: He had borrowed a prototype of a headset created by a 19-year-old VR enthusiast named Palmer Luckey and hacked it to run a VR version of the game  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eDoom\u003c/em\u003e . Its face was covered with duct tape, and a strap ripped from a pair of Oakley ski goggles was all that held it to your head, but it worked. When people put on the headset, they found themselves surrounded by the 3D graphics they\u0026#39;d normally see on a TV or monitor. They weren\u0026#39;t just playing  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eDoom\u003c/em\u003e —they were  \u003cem class='italic'\u003einside\u003c/em\u003e  it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThings happened fast after that. Luckey\u0026#39;s company, Oculus, raised more than $2 million on Kickstarter to produce the headset, which he called the Oculus Rift. In 2014, Facebook purchased Oculus for nearly $3 billion. (\u0026#34;Oculus has the chance to create the most social platform ever, and change the way we work, play and communicate,\u0026#34; Mark Zuckerberg said at the time.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn 2016, the first wave of dedicated consumer VR headsets arrived, though all three were effectively peripherals rather than full systems: The Oculus Rift and the HTC Vive each connected to high-powered PCs, and the PlayStation VR system ran off a PlayStation 4 game console. In 2018, the first \u0026#34;stand-alone\u0026#34; headsets hit the market. They don\u0026#39;t connect to a computer or depend on your smartphone to supply the display and processing; they\u0026#39;re self-contained, all-in-one devices that make VR truly easy to use for the first time ever.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn 2020 the world of VR is going to be defined by these stand-alone headsets. The tethered-to-a-desktop headsets are still a high-end option for die-hards looking for the highest fidelity experiences possible, but an untethered stand-alone headset delivers on the promise of deeply immersive VR in the way previous tethered versions just haven’t—at least not without spending serious cash on hardware and accessories. The first next-gen stand-alone headsets are starting to hit store shelves already.

The easiest but least satisfying response is that it\u0026#39;s for everything. Beyond games and other interactive entertainment, VR shows promising applications for  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/opioids-havent-solved-chronic-pain-maybe-virtual-reality-can/' class='link'\u003epain relief\u003c/a\u003e  and PTSD, for education and design, for both telecommuting and office work. Thanks to \u0026#34;embodied presence\u0026#34;—you occupy an avatar in virtual space—social VR is not just more immersive than any digitally mediated communication we\u0026#39;ve ever experienced, but more affecting as well. The experiences we have virtually, from our reactions to our surroundings to the quality of our interactions, are stored and retrieved in our brains like any other experiential memory.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYet, for all the billions of dollars poured into the field, nothing has yet emerged as the iPhone of VR: the product that combines compelling technology with an intuitive, desirable form. And while augmented and mixed reality are still a few years behind VR, it stands to reason that these related technologies won\u0026#39;t remain distinct for long, instead merging into a single device that can deliver immersive, shut-out-the-world VR experiences—and then become transparent to let you interact with the world again.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat may end up coming from Apple; the Cupertino company is  \u003ca href='https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-11/apple-s-ar-push-will-start-with-ipad-and-culminate-with-glasses' class='link'\u003ereportedly\u003c/a\u003e  at work on a headset that could launch as early as 2020.

The internet is great; how people treat each other on the internet, not so much. Apply that logic to VR, where being embodied as an avatar means you have personal boundaries that can be violated, and where spatialized audio and haptic feedback lets you hear and  \u003cem class='italic'\u003efeel\u003c/em\u003e  what other people are saying and doing to you, and you\u0026#39;re looking at a potential for harassment and toxic behavior that\u0026#39;s exponentially more visceral and traumatizing than anything on conventional social media.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd then there\u0026#39;s the question of authentication. The internet has given us phishing and catfishing, deep fakes, and fake news.

Thomas was from rural Tennessee and had studied  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/tag/computer-science/' class='link'\u003ecomputer science\u003c/a\u003e  at the University of Missouri. His résumé said he’d been a professional programmer for eight years, and he’d breezed through a preliminary  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/tech-job-interviews-out-of-control/' class='link'\u003ecoding test\u003c/a\u003e . All of this was excellent news for Thomas’ prospective boss, Simon Wijckmans, founder of the web security startup C.Side. The 27-year-old Belgian was based in London but was looking for ambitious,  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/5-ways-work-remotely-effectively/' class='link'\u003efully remote\u003c/a\u003e  coders.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThomas had an Anglo-Saxon surname, so Wijckmans was surprised when he clicked into his Google Meet and found himself speaking with a heavily accented young man of Asian origin. Thomas had set a generic image of an office as his background. His internet connection was laggy—odd for a professional coder—and his end of the call was noisy. To Wijckmans, Thomas sounded like he was sitting in a large, crowded space, maybe a dorm or a call center.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eWijckmans fired off his interview questions, and Thomas’ responses were solid enough. But Wijckmans noticed that Thomas seemed most interested in asking about his salary. He didn’t come across as curious about the actual work or about how the company operated or even about benefits like startup stock or health coverage. Odd, thought Wijckmans.

He used a basic virtual background, was on a terrible internet connection, and had a single-minded focus on salary. This candidate, though, was wearing glasses. In the lenses, Wijckmans spotted the reflection of multiple screens, and he could make out a white chatbox with messages scrolling by. “He was clearly either chatting with somebody or on some AI tool,” Wijckmans remembers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn high alert, Wijckmans grabbed screenshots and took notes.

He found that his company’s listings were being flooded with applicants just like these: an opening for a full-stack developer got more than 500 applications in a day, far more than usual.

A bubbly 44-year-old with curly red hair and glasses, she loved her dogs and her mom and posting social justice content on TikTok. In her spare time she listened to K-pop, enjoyed Renaissance fairs, and got into cosplay. Chapman was also, according to her sparse online résumé, learning to code online.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt was March 2020 when she clicked on the message in her LinkedIn account. A foreign company was looking for somebody to “be the US face” of the business. The company needed help finding remote employment for overseas workers. Chapman signed on. It’s unclear how fast her workload grew, but by October 2022 she could afford a move from chilly Minnesota to a low-slung, four-bedroom house in Litchfield Park, Arizona. It wasn’t fancy—a suburban corner lot with a few thin trees—but it was a big upgrade over the trailer.\u003c/p\u003e\u003caside class='PullQuoteEmbedWrapper-sc-EoVjf kgVYDs'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe pandemic dramatically expanded the number of remote jobs, and Pyongyang saw the perfect opportunity.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\u003cp\u003eChapman then started documenting more of her life on TikTok and YouTube, mostly talking about her diet, fitness, or mental health. In one chatty video, shared in June 2023, she described grabbing breakfast on the go—an açaí bowl and a smoothie— because work was so busy. “My clients are going crazy!” she complained. In the background, the camera caught a glimpse of metal racks holding at least a dozen open laptops covered in sticky notes. A few months later, federal investigators raided Chapman’s home, seized the laptops, and eventually filed charges alleging that she had spent three years aiding the “illicit revenue generation efforts” of the government of North Korea.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor maybe a decade, North Korean intelligence services have been training young IT workers and sending them abroad in teams, often to China or Russia. From these bases, they scour the web for job listings all over, usually in software engineering, and usually with Western companies. They favor roles that are fully remote, with solid wages, good access to data and systems, and few responsibilities. Over time they began applying for these jobs using stolen or fake identities and relying on members of their criminal teams to provide fictional references; some have even started using AI to pass coding tests, video interviews, and background checks.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut if an applicant lands a job offer, the syndicate needs somebody on the ground in the country the applicant claims to live in. A fake employee, after all, can’t use the addresses or bank accounts linked to their stolen IDs, and they can’t dial in to a company’s networks from overseas without instantly triggering suspicion. That’s where someone like Christina Chapman comes in.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs the “facilitator” for hundreds of North Korea–linked jobs, Chapman signed fraudulent documents and handled some of the fake workers’ salaries. She would often receive their paychecks in one of her bank accounts, take a cut, and wire the rest overseas: Federal prosecutors say Chapman was promised as much as 30 percent of the money that passed through her hands.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHer most important job, though, was tending the “laptop farm.” After being hired, a fake worker will typically ask for their company computer to be sent to a different address than the one on record—usually with some tale about a last-minute move or needing to stay with a sick relative. The new address, of course, belongs to the facilitator, in this case Chapman. Sometimes the facilitator forwards the laptop to an address overseas, but more commonly that person holds onto it and installs software that allows it to be controlled remotely. Then the fake employee can connect to their machine from anywhere in the world while appearing to be in the US. (“You know how to install Anydesk?” one North Korean operative asked Chapman in 2022. “I do it practically EVERYDAY!” she replied.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn messages with her handlers, Chapman discussed sending government forms like the I-9, which attests that a person is legally able to work in the US. (“I did my best to copy your signature,” she wrote. “Haha. Thank you,” came the response.) She also did basic tech troubleshooting and dialed into meetings on a worker’s behalf, sometimes on short notice, as in this conversation from November 2023:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem class='italic'\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eWorker:\u003c/strong\u003e We are going to have laptop setup meeting in 20 mins.

I can go to FEDERAL PRISON for falsifying federal documents.” Michael Barnhart, an investigator at cybersecurity company DTEX and a leading expert on the North Korean IT worker threat, says Chapman’s involvement followed a standard pattern—from an innocuous initial contact on LinkedIn to escalating requests. “Little by little, the asks get bigger and bigger,” he says. “Then by the end of the day, you’re asking the facilitator to go to a government facility to pick up an actual government ID.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure class='AssetEmbedWrapper-eVDQiB byBkf asset-embed'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cpicture class='ResponsiveImagePicture-cWuUZO dUOtEa AssetEmbedResponsiveAsset-cXBNxi lqMXz asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image'\u003e\u003cimg src='https://media.wired.com/photos/6812569c75d9458c4f548687/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/IMG_1073_FINAL%2520APPROVED.jpg' alt='Conceptual photograph of laptop with usernames on sticky notes'\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003ePhotograph: Julia Chesky\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eBy the time investigators raided Chapman’s home, she was housing several dozen laptops, each with a sticky note indicating the fake worker’s identity and employer. Some of the North Korean operatives worked multiple jobs; some had been toiling quietly for years. Prosecutors said at least 300 employers had been pulled into this single scheme, including “a top-five national television network and media company, a premier Silicon Valley technology company, an aerospace and defense manufacturer, an iconic American car manufacturer, a high-end retail store, and one of the most recognizable media and entertainment companies in the world.” Chapman, they alleged, had helped pass along at least $17 million. She pleaded guilty in February 2025 to charges relating to wire fraud, identity theft, and money laundering and is awaiting sentencing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eChapman’s case is just one of several North Korean fake-worker prosecutions making their way through US courts. A Ukrainian named Oleksandr Didenko has been accused of setting up a freelancing website to connect fake IT workers with stolen identities. Prosecutors say at least one worker was linked to Chapman’s laptop farm and that Didenko also has ties to operations in San Diego and Virginia. Didenko was arrested in Poland last year and was extradited to the United States. In Tennessee, 38-year-old Matthew Knoot is due to stand trial for his alleged role in a scheme that investigators say sent hundreds of thousands of dollars to accounts linked to North Korea via his laptop farm in Nashville. (Knoot has pleaded not guilty.) And in January 2025, Florida prosecutors filed charges against two American citizens, Erick Ntekereze Prince and Emanuel Ashtor, as well as a Mexican accomplice and two North Koreans.

As recently as 2010, that one link to the web was reserved for use by high-ranking officials. Then, in 2011, 27-year-old Kim Jong Un succeeded his father as the country’s dictator. Secretly educated in Switzerland and said to be an avid gamer, the younger Kim made IT a national priority. In 2012, he urged some schools to “pay special attention to intensifying their computer education” to create new possibilities for the government and military. Computer science is now on some high school curricula, while college students can take courses on information security, robotics, and engineering.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe most promising students are taught  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/north-korea-hacker-internet-outage/' class='link'\u003ehacking techniques\u003c/a\u003e  and foreign languages that can make them more effective operatives. Staff from government agencies including the Reconnaissance General Bureau— the nation’s clandestine intelligence service—recruit the highest-scoring graduates of top schools like Kim Chaek University of Technology (described by many as “the MIT of North Korea”) or the prestigious University of Sciences in Pyongsong. They are promised good wages and unfettered access to the internet—the real internet, not the intranet available to well-off North Koreans, which consists of a mere handful of heavily censored North Korean websites.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe earliest cyberattacks launched by Pyongyang were simple affairs: defacing websites with political messages or launching denial-of-service attacks to shut down US websites. They soon grew more audacious. In 2014, North Korean hackers famously stole and leaked confidential information from Sony’s film studio. Then they targeted financial institutions: Fraudulent trades pulled more than $81 million from the Bank of Bangladesh’s accounts at the New York Federal Reserve. After that, North Korean hackers moved into ransomware—the WannaCry attack in 2017 locked hundreds of thousands of Windows computers in 150 countries and demanded payments in bitcoin. While the amount of revenue the attack generated is up for debate—some say it earned just $140,000 in payouts—it wreaked much wider damage as companies worked to upgrade their systems and security, costing as much as $4 billion, according to one estimate.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGovernments responded with more sanctions and stronger security measures, and the regime pivoted, dialing back on ransomware in favor of quieter schemes. It turns out these are also more lucrative: Today, the most valuable tool in North Korea’s cybercrime armory is cryptocurrency theft. In 2022, hackers stole more than $600 million worth of the cryptocurrency ether by attacking the blockchain game  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eAxie Infinity\u003c/em\u003e ; in February of this year, they robbed the Dubai-based crypto exchange Bybit of $1.5 billion worth of digital currency.

Some of these workers are based in the country, but many are stationed overseas in China, Russia, Pakistan, or elsewhere. They are relatively well compensated, but their posting is hardly cushy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTeams of 10 to 20 young men live and work out of a single apartment, sleeping four or five to a room and grinding up to 14 hours a day at weird hours to correspond with their remote job’s time zone.

Sometimes, though, North Korean operatives last just a few days— enough time to download huge amounts of company data or plant malicious software in a company’s systems before abruptly quitting. That code could alter financial data or manipulate security information. Or these seeds could lay dormant for months, even years.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“The potential risk from even one minute of access to systems is almost unlimited for an individual company,” says Declan Cummings, the head of engineering at software company Cinder.

They take a green-colored card the exact shape and size of an identity card—a mini green screen—and, using deepfake technology, project the image of an ID onto it. “They can actually move it and show the reflection,” says Greene. “It’s very sophisticated.” North Korean agents have even been known to send look-alikes to pick up a physical ID card from an office or to take a drug test required by prospective employers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eEven security experts can be fooled.

We didn’t have any reason to suspect this wasn’t a valid candidate.” But when his facilitator—the US-based individual giving him cover—tried to install malware on Kyle’s company computer, the security team caught on and shut him out.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eBack in london,\u003c/span\u003e  Simon Wijckmans couldn’t let go of the idea that somebody had tried to fool him.

He’s maybe in his late twenties, with short, straight, black hair. Everything about him seems deliberately nonspecific: He wears a plain black crewneck sweater and speaks into an off-brand headset. “I just woke up early today for this interview, no problem,” he says. “I know that working with UK hours is kind of a requirement, so I can get my working hours to yours, so no problem with it.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo far, everything matches the hallmarks of a fake worker. Harry’s virtual background is one of the default options provided by Google Meet, and his connection is a touch slow. His English is good but heavily accented, even though he tells us he was born in New York and grew up in Brooklyn. Wijckmans starts with some typical interview questions, and Harry keeps glancing off to his right as he responds. He talks about various coding languages and name-drops the frameworks he’s familiar with. Wijckmans starts asking some deeper technical questions. Harry pauses.

We wrap up the conversation abruptly.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI try to put myself in the seat of a hiring manager or screener who’s under pressure.

I suspect at least one of them could have made it to the next step in some unsuspecting company’s hiring process.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWijckmans tells me he has a plan if he comes across another pretender. He has created a web page that looks like a standard coding assessment, which he’ll send to fake candidates. As soon as they hit the button to start the test, their browser will spawn dozens of pop-up pages that bounce around the screen, all of them featuring information on how to defect from North Korea.

But maybe it will irritate them for a moment.

Apple Denies It\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe security firm iVerify this week brought to light a series of suspicious iPhone crashes that researchers say might just indicate a stealthy, unprecedented Chinese zero-click hacking campaign victimizing American phones, including even those of staffers for the Harris-Walz presidential campaign. Or it’s a random, not-particularly-dangerous bug that Apple has already squashed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn a report released Thursday, iVerify assessed with “moderate confidence” that China-linked hackers may have targeted a series of iPhones with a sophisticated exploit, going after activists and dissidents critical of China, an EU government official, tech executives at AI firms competing with Chinese ones, and US political staffers—revealed by NBC News to be employees of the Harris-Walz campaign. iVerify didn’t have a sample of the malware that might have infected those phones or other definitive proof that any hacking occurred. But it pointed to signs that seem like more than coincidences: The staffers whose phones had experienced the crashes had also been warned by the FBI that they’d already been targeted in China’s Salt Typhoon hacking campaign against US telecoms. Another owner of the devices that crashed in the same way was later warned by Apple itself that he or she had been targeted by sophisticated hackers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eAll of that would represent a serious threat to national security. Except that, strangely, Apple flatly denies it happened. “We strongly disagree with the claims of a targeted attack against our users,” Apple’s head of security engineering, Ivan Krstić, wrote in a statement to WIRED. Apple has patched the issue that iVerify highlighted in its report, which caused iPhones to crash in certain cases when a message sender changed their own nickname and avatar. But it calls those crashes the result of a “conventional software bug,” not evidence of a targeted exploitation. (That blanket denial certainly isn’t Apple’s usual response to confirmed iPhone hacking. The company has, for instance, sued hacking firm NSO group for its targeting of Apple customers.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe result is that what might have been a four-alarm fire in the counterintelligence world is reduced—for now—to a very troubling enigma.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 class='text-xl font-semibold'\u003e\u003ca href='https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-dhs-thomas-fugate-cp3-terrorism-prevention' class='link'\u003eA 22-Year-Old Is Running a Key US Anti-Terrorism Program\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eA 22-year-old former intern at the Heritage Foundation with no national security experience has reportedly been appointed to a key Department of Homeland Security role overseeing a major program designed to combat domestic terrorism.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAccording to Propublica, Thomas Fugate last month assumed leadership of the Center for Programs and Partnerships (CP3), a DHS office tasked with funding nationwide efforts to prevent politically motivated violence—including school shootings and other forms of domestic terrorism.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFugate, a 2024 graduate of the University of Texas at San Antonio, replaced the former CP3 director, Bill Braniff, an Army veteran with 20 years of national security experience who resigned in March following staff cuts ordered by the Trump administration.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAccording to CP3’s most recent report to Congress, the office has funded more than 1,100 initiatives aimed at disrupting violent extremism.

Every threat intelligence company, in a scientifically defensible attempt to not make any assumption that they’re tracking the same hackers as another firm, comes up with their own code name for any group they observe. The result is a somewhat silly profusion of overlapping naming systems based on elements, weather, and zoology: “Fancy Bear” is “Forest Blizzard” is “APT28” is “Strontium.” Now, several major threat intelligence players, including Google, Microsoft, CrowdStrike, and Palo Alto Networks, have finally shared enough of their internal research to agree to a glossary that confirms that they’re referring to the same entities. The companies did  \u003cem class='italic'\u003enot,\u003c/em\u003e  however, agree to consolidate their naming systems into a single taxonomy.

After battery developer QuantumScape merged with a SPAC in 2020, its market cap exceeded General Motors’—even though the company expected no sales for many years. Easy money also fueled market liquidity, helping venture capitalists exit their investments. Never before were so many unprofitable companies floated at such high valuations. In 2021, more than a thousand IPOs came to the US markets, more than double the previous record.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe punch bowl was removed from the VC party after the Fed started to raise interest rates in 2022. QuantumScape’s stock is down more than 90 percent—but at least, unlike many other startups, it’s still in business. Bankman-Fried is in jail, awaiting trial. The IPO market has dried up. New entrants into the VC world have run for the hills. Others face large capital calls from VC funds they committed to during good times. Starved of fresh funds, many startups face a bleak future. WeWork, which grandly describes itself as an “office solutions company” (sounds better than “rentals”) and once sported a valuation of close to $50 billion, is the latest to hit the skids.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Nasdaq index of technology stocks rebounded strongly in the first half of 2023. There’s huge excitement around artificial intelligence—NVIDIA, whose graphic processing units are used for AI, is valued at more than a trillion dollars. Great speculative bubbles, however, take years to unwind. Bear market rebounds, otherwise known as “sucker’s rallies,” are commonplace. After the dotcom bust, it took the Nasdaq a year and a half to trough (and more than 15 years to regain its peak).

More startups will go bust, and venture capital funds will continue to post negative returns. As for Nvidia, it’s worth recalling what happened to Cisco Systems. During the dotcom bubble, Cisco, whose servers powered the internet, was briefly the world’s most valuable company. Its stock traded at nearly 40 times sales before crashing. More than two decades later, Cisco’s share price remains well below the bubble peak.

Like other extraordinary beings (Beyoncé, Cher, Pelé), the latter goes by a single name, in this case a pedestrian one, reflecting its pliancy and comity. Oh, and it’s an AI model. Hi, Claude!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAmodei has just gotten back from Davos, where he fanned the flames at fireside chats by declaring that in two or so years Claude and its peers will surpass people in every cognitive task. Hardly recovered from the trip, he and Claude are now dealing with an unexpected crisis. A Chinese company called DeepSeek has just released a state-of-the-art large language model that it purportedly built for a fraction of what companies like Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic spent. The current paradigm of cutting-edge AI, which consists of multibillion-dollar expenditures on hardware and energy, suddenly seemed shaky.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eAmodei is perhaps the person most associated with these companies’ maximalist approach. Back when he worked at OpenAI, Amodei wrote an internal paper on something he’d mulled for years: a hypothesis called the Big Blob of Compute. AI architects knew, of course, that the more data you had, the more powerful your models could be. Amodei proposed that that information could be more raw than they assumed; if they fed megatons of the stuff to their models, they could hasten the arrival of powerful AI. The theory is now standard practice, and it’s the reason why the leading models are so expensive to build. Only a few deep-pocketed companies could compete.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow a newcomer,  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/deepseek-china-model-ai/' class='link'\u003eDeepSeek\u003c/a\u003e —from a country subject to export controls on the most powerful chips—had waltzed in without a big blob.

But Amodei makes it clear that DeepSeek isn’t keeping him up at night. He rejects the idea that more efficient models will enable low-budget competitors to jump to the front of the line. “It’s just the opposite!” he says. “The value of what you’re making goes up. If you’re getting more intelligence per dollar, you might want to spend even more dollars on intelligence!” Far more important than saving money, he argues, is getting to the AGI finish line. That’s why, even after DeepSeek, companies like OpenAI and Microsoft announced plans to spend hundreds of billions of dollars more on data centers and power plants.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003caside class='Sidebar-pgAgH kmwJca'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/frontiers-of-computing/' class='link'\u003eHow to Get Computers—Before Computers Get You\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/frontiers-of-computing/' class='link'\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class='AssetEmbedWrapper-eVDQiB byBkf asset-embed'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/frontiers-of-computing/' class='link'\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cpicture class='ResponsiveImagePicture-cWuUZO dUOtEa AssetEmbedResponsiveAsset-cXBNxi lqMXz asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image'\u003e\u003cimg src='https://media.wired.com/photos/67d9dd91de323b7691481577/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/WIRED-This-Is-Your-Brain-On-Computers-Cover-Design.jpg' alt='Image may contain Advertisement and Poster'\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003ePost-quantum algorithms, thermodynamic hardware, open source architectures, apocalypse-proof programming, and more: WIRED journeys to the freaky \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/frontiers-of-computing/' class='link'\u003efrontiers of modern computing\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat Amodei does obsess over is how humans can reach AGI safely.

But Claude is everywhere and has been since the early days, when Anthropic engineers first trained it, raised it, and then used it to produce better Claudes. If Amodei’s dream comes true, Claude will be both our wing model and fairy godmodel as we enter an age of abundance.

In the 1970s, their parents, Elena Engel and Riccardo Amodei, moved from Italy to San Francisco. Dario was born in 1983 and Daniela four years later. Riccardo, a leather craftsman from a tiny town near the island of Elba, took ill when the children were small and died when they were young adults.

As he got older he became fixated on math. “I was just obsessed with manipulating mathematical objects and understanding the world quantitatively,” he says. Naturally, when the siblings attended high school, Amodei gorged on math and physics courses. Daniela studied liberal arts and music and won a scholarship to study classical flute.

He swiftly concluded that the field was too removed from the real world. “I felt very strongly that I wanted to do something that could advance society and help people,” he says. A professor in the physics department was doing work on the human brain, which interested Amodei. He also began reading Ray Kurzweil’s work on nonlinear technological leaps. Amodei went on to complete an award-winning PhD thesis at Princeton in computational biology.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn 2014 he took a job at the US research lab of the Chinese search company Baidu. Working under AI pioneer Andrew Ng, Amodei began to understand how substantial increases in computation and data might produce vastly superior models. Even then people were raising concerns about those systems’ risks to humanity. Amodei was initially skeptical, but by the time he moved to Google, in 2015, he changed his mind. “Before, I was like, we’re not building those systems, so what can we really do?” he says. “But now we’re building the systems.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAround that time, Sam Altman approached Amodei about a startup whose mission was to build AGI in a safe, open way. Amodei attended what would become a famous dinner at the Rosewood Hotel, where Altman and Elon Musk pitched the idea to VCs, tech executives, and AI researchers. “I wasn’t swayed,” Amodei says. “I was  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eanti\u003c/em\u003e -swayed. The goals weren’t clear to me. It felt like it was more about celebrity tech investors and entrepreneurs than AI researchers.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eMonths later, OpenAI organized as a nonprofit company with the stated goal of advancing AI such that it is “most likely to benefit humanity as a whole, unconstrained by a need to generate financial return.” Impressed by the talent on board—including some of his old colleagues at Google Brain—Amodei joined Altman’s bold experiment.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt OpenAI, Amodei refined his ideas. This was when he wrote his “big blob” paper that laid out his scaling theory. The implications seemed scarier than ever. “My first thought,” he says, “was, oh my God, could systems that are smarter than humans figure out how to destabilize the nuclear deterrent?” Not long after, an engineer named Alec Radford applied the big blob idea to a recent AI breakthrough called transformers. GPT-1 was born.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAround then, Daniela Amodei also joined OpenAI. She had taken a circuitous path to the job. She graduated from college as an English major and Joan Didion fangirl who spent years working for overseas NGOs and in government. She wound up back in the Bay Area and became an early employee at Stripe. Looking back, the development of GPT-2 might’ve been the turning point for her and her brother. Daniela was managing the team. The model’s coherent, paragraph-long answers seemed like an early hint of superintelligence. Seeing it in operation blew Amodei’s mind—and terrified him. “We had one of the craziest secrets in the world here,” he says. “This is going to determine the fate of nations.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAmodei urged people at OpenAI to not release the full model right away. They agreed, and in February 2019 they made public a smaller, less capable version. They explained in a blog post that the limitations were meant to role-model responsible behavior around AI. “I didn’t know if this model was dangerous,” Amodei says, “but my general feeling was that we should do something to signpost that”—to make clear that the models  \u003cem class='italic'\u003ecould\u003c/em\u003e  be dangerous. A few months later, OpenAI released the full model.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe conversations around responsibility started to shift. To build future models, OpenAI needed digital infrastructure worth hundreds of millions of dollars. To secure it, the company expanded its partnership with Microsoft. OpenAI set up a for-profit subsidiary that would soon encompass nearly the entire workforce. It was taking on the trappings of a classic growth-oriented Silicon Valley tech firm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA number of employees began to worry about where the company was headed. Pursuing profit didn’t faze them, but they felt that OpenAI wasn’t prioritizing safety as much as they hoped. Among them—no surprise—was Amodei. “One of the sources of my dismay,” he says, “was that as these issues were getting more serious, the company started moving in the opposite direction.” He took his concerns to Altman, who he says would listen carefully and agree. Then nothing would change, Amodei says. (OpenAI chose not to comment on this story. But its stance is that safety has been a constant.) Gradually the disaffected found each other and shared their doubts. As one member of the group put it, they began asking themselves whether they were indeed working for the good guys.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure class='AssetEmbedWrapper-eVDQiB byBkf asset-embed'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cpicture class='ResponsiveImagePicture-cWuUZO dUOtEa AssetEmbedResponsiveAsset-cXBNxi lqMXz asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image'\u003e\u003cimg src='https://media.wired.com/photos/67d9d5b8ff780c4c689b65e8/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/WIRED_ANTHROPIC_ChrisOlah_004.jpg' alt='Image may contain Body Part Face Head Neck Person Happy Smile Photography Portrait Adult Blonde and Hair'\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cp\u003eChris Olah is a former Thiel Fellow whose team looks inside Claude’s brain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003ePhotograph: Amber Hakim\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eAmodei says that when he told Altman he was leaving, the CEO made repeated offers for him to stay.

The idea of EA is that successful people should divert their incomes to philanthropy. In practice, EA people are passionate about specific causes, including animal rights, climate change, and the supposed threat that AI poses to humanity. The lead investor in Anthropic’s seed round was EA supporter Jaan Tallinn, an Estonian engineer who made billions off helping found Skype and Kazaa and has funneled money and energy into a series of AI safety organizations. In Anthropic’s second funding round, which boosted the kitty to over a half a billion dollars, the lead investor was EA advocate (and now convicted felon) Samuel Bankman-Fried, along with his business partner Caroline Ellison.

Ask Daniela about it and she says, “I’m not the expert on effective altruism. I don’t identify with that terminology. My impression is that it’s a bit of an outdated term.” Yet her husband, Holden Karnofsky, cofounded one of EA’s most conspicuous philanthropy wings, is outspoken about AI safety, and, in January 2025, joined Anthropic. Many others also remain engaged with EA. As early employee Amanda Askell puts it, “I definitely have met people here who are effective altruists, but it’s not a theme of the organization or anything.” (Her ex-husband, William MacAskill, is an originator of the movement.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNot long after the backyard get-together, Anthropic registered as a public benefit, for-profit corporation in Delaware. Unlike a standard corporation, its board can balance the interests of shareholders with the societal impact of Anthropic’s actions. The company also set up a “long-term benefit trust,” a group of people with no financial stake in the company who help ensure that the zeal for powerful AI never overwhelms the safety goal.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnthropic’s first order of business was to build a model that could match or exceed the work of OpenAI, Google, and Meta. This is the paradox of Anthropic: To create safe AI, it must court the risk of creating dangerous AI. “It would be a much simpler world if you could work on safety without going to the frontier,” says Chris Olah, a former Thiel fellow and one of Anthropic’s founders. “But it doesn’t seem to be the world that we’re in.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“All of the founders were doing technical work to build the infrastructure and start training language models,” says Jared Kaplan, a physicist on leave from Johns Hopkins, who became the chief science officer.

Anthropic’s models would soon be offered to AWS customers. Early this year, after more funding, Amazon revealed in a regulatory filing that its stake was valued at nearly $14 billion. Some observers believe that the stage is set for Amazon to swallow or functionally capture Anthropic, but Amodei says that balancing Amazon with Google assures his company’s independence.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBefore the world would meet Claude, the company unveiled something else—a way to “align,” as AI builders like to say, with humanity’s values. The idea is to have AI police itself. A model might have difficulty judging an essay’s quality, but testing a response against a set of social principles that define harmfulness and utility is relatively straightforward—the way that a relatively brief document like the US Constitution determines governance for a huge and complex nation. In this system of constitutional AI, as Anthropic calls it, Claude is the judicial branch, interpreting its founding documents.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe idealistic Anthropic team cherry-picked the constitutional principles from select documents. Those included the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Apple’s terms of service, and Sparrow, a set of anti-racist and anti-violence judgments created by DeepMind. Anthropic added a list of commonsense principles—sort of an AGI version of  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eAll I Really Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten\u003c/em\u003e . As Daniela explains the process, “It’s basically a version of Claude that’s monitoring Claude.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnthropic developed another safety protocol, called Responsible Scaling Policy. Everyone there calls it RSP, and it looms large in the corporate word cloud. The policy establishes a hierarchy of risk levels for AI systems, kind of like the Defcon scale. Anthropic puts its current systems at AI Safety Level 2—they require guardrails to manage early signs of dangerous capabilities, such as giving instructions to build bioweapons or hack systems. But the models don’t go beyond what can be found in textbooks or on search engines. At Level 3, systems begin to work autonomously. Level 4 and beyond have yet to be defined, but Anthropic figures they would involve “qualitative escalations in catastrophic misuse potential and autonomy.” Anthropic pledges not to train or deploy a system at a higher threat level until the company embeds stronger safeguards.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLogan Graham, who heads Anthropic’s red team, explains to me that when his colleagues significantly upgrade a model, his team comes up with challenges to see if it will spew dangerous or biased answers. The engineers then tweak the model until the red team is satisfied. “The entire company waits for us,” Graham says. “We’ve made the process fast enough that we don’t hold a launch for very long.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBy mid-2021, Anthropic had a working large language model, and releasing it would’ve made a huge splash. But the company held back. “Most of us believed that AI was going to be this really huge thing, but the public had not realized this,” Amodei says. OpenAI’s ChatGPT hadn’t come out yet. “Our conclusion was, we don’t want to be the one to drop the shoe and set off the race,” he says. “We let someone else do that.” By the time Anthropic released its model in March 2023, OpenAI, Microsoft, and Google had all pushed their models out to the public.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e“It was costly to us,” Amodei admits. He sees that corporate hesitation as a “one-off.” “In that one instance, we probably did the right thing. But that is not sustainable.” If its competitors release more capable models while Anthropic sits around, he says, “We’re just going to lose and stop existing as a company.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eIt would seem\u003c/span\u003e  an irresolvable dilemma: Either hold back and lose or jump in and put humanity at risk. Amodei believes that his Race to the Top solves the problem. It’s remarkably idealistic. Be a role model of what trustworthy models might look like, and figure that others will copy you. “If you do something good, you can inspire employees at other companies,” he explains, “or cause them to criticize their companies.” Government regulation would also help, in the company’s view. (Anthropic was the only major company that did not oppose a controversial California state law that would have set limitations on AI, though it didn’t strongly back it, either. Governor Gavin Newsom ultimately vetoed it.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAmodei believes his strategy is working. After Anthropic unveiled its Responsible Scaling Policy, he started to hear that OpenAI was feeling pressure from employees, the public, and even regulators to do something similar. Three months later OpenAI announced its Preparedness Framework. (In February 2025, Meta came out with its version.) Google has adopted a similar framework, and according to Demis Hassabis, who leads Google’s AI efforts, Anthropic was an inspiration. “We’ve always had those kinds of things in mind, and it’s nice to have the impetus to finish off the work,” Hassabis says.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class='AssetEmbedWrapper-eVDQiB byBkf asset-embed'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cpicture class='ResponsiveImagePicture-cWuUZO dUOtEa AssetEmbedResponsiveAsset-cXBNxi lqMXz asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image'\u003e\u003cimg src='https://media.wired.com/photos/67d9d5b4c83bcf31daef73a0/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/WIRED_ANTHROPIC_office_008.jpg' alt='Image may contain Plant Indoors Chair Furniture Person Interior Design Shop Grocery Store Market and Supermarket'\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnthropic takes up all 10 floors in a modern San Francisco office building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003ePhotographer: Amber Hakim\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen there’s what happened at OpenAI. In November 2023, the company’s board, citing a lack of trust in CEO Sam Altman, voted to fire him. Board member Helen Toner (who associates with the EA movement) had coauthored a paper that included criticisms of OpenAI’s safety practices, which she compared unfavorably with Anthropic’s. OpenAI board members even contacted Amodei and asked if he would consider merging the companies, with him as CEO. Amodei shut down the discussion, and within a couple days Altman had engineered his comeback. Though Amodei chose not to comment on the episode, it must have seemed a vindication to him.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eDeepMind’s Hassabis says he appreciates Anthropic’s efforts to model responsible AI. “If we join in,” he says, “then others do as well, and suddenly you’ve got critical mass.” He also acknowledges that in the fury of competition, those stricter safety standards might be a tough sell. “There is a different race, a race to the bottom, where if you’re behind in getting the performance up to a certain level but you’ve got good engineering talent, you can cut some corners,” he says. “It remains to be seen whether the race to the top or the race to the bottom wins out.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class='AssetEmbedWrapper-eVDQiB byBkf asset-embed'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cpicture class='ResponsiveImagePicture-cWuUZO dUOtEa AssetEmbedResponsiveAsset-cXBNxi lqMXz asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image'\u003e\u003cimg src='https://media.wired.com/photos/67d9d5b77b1562499f7101cc/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/WIRED_ANTHROPIC_office_009.jpg' alt='Image may contain Plant Chair Furniture Aircraft Airplane Transportation and Vehicle'\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnthropic\u0026#39;s offices overlook San Francisco\u0026#39;s Transbay Terminal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eAmodei feels that society has yet to grok the urgency of the situation. “There is compelling evidence that the models can wreak havoc,” he says.

Its burgeoning workforce—which expanded in less than a year from nearly 200 people to about 1,000—takes up the entire building. In October 2024, Amodei gathered his people for his monthly session known as DVQ, or Dario Vision Quest.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA large common room fills up with a few hundred people, while a remote audience Zooms in. Daniela sits in the front row. Amodei, decked in a gray T-shirt, checks his slides and grabs a mic. This DVQ is different, he says. Usually he’d riff on four topics, but this time he’s devoting the whole hour to a single question: What happens with powerful AI if things go  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eright\u003c/em\u003e ?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEven as Amodei is frustrated with the public’s poor grasp of AI’s dangers, he’s also concerned that the benefits aren’t getting across. Not surprisingly, the company that grapples with the specter of AI doom was becoming synonymous with doomerism. So over the course of two frenzied days he banged out a nearly 14,000-word manifesto called “Machines of Loving Grace.” Now he’s ready to share it. He’ll soon release it on the web and even bind it into an elegant booklet. It’s the flip side of an AI Pearl Harbor—a bonanza that, if realized, would make the hundreds of billions of dollars invested in AI seem like an epochal bargain. One suspects that this rosy outcome also serves to soothe the consciences of Amodei and his fellow Anthros should they ask themselves why they are working on something that, by their own admission, might wipe out the species.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe vision he spins makes Shangri-La look like a slum. Not long from now, maybe even in 2026, Anthropic or someone else will reach AGI. Models will outsmart Nobel Prize winners. These models will control objects in the real world and may even design their own custom computers. Millions of copies of the models will work together—imagine an entire nation of geniuses in a data center! Bye-bye cancer, infectious diseases, depression; hello lifespans of up to 1,200 years.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAmodei pauses the talk to take questions. What about mind-uploading? That’s probably in the cards, says Amodei. He has a slide on just that.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe dwells on health issues so long that he hardly touches on possible breakthroughs in economics and governance, areas where he concedes that human messiness might thwart the brilliant solutions of his nation of geniuses. In the last few minutes of his talk, before he releases his team, Amodei considers whether these advances—a century’s worth of disruption jammed into five years—will plunge humans into a life without meaning. He’s optimistic that people can weather the big shift. “We’re not the prophets causing this to happen,” he tells his team. “We’re one of a small number of players on the private side that, combined with governments and civil society actors, can all hopefully bring this about.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt would seem a heavy lift, since it will involve years of financing—and actually making money at some point. Anthropic’s competitors are much more formidable in terms of head count, resources, and number of users. But Anthropic isn’t relying just on humans. It has Claude.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThere’s something different\u003c/span\u003e  about Anthropic’s model. Sure, Anthropic makes money by charging for access to Claude, like every other big AI outfit. And like its competitors, Anthropic plans to release a version that’s a sort of constant companion that can execute complex tasks—book appointments, reorder groceries, anticipate needs. But more than other AIs, Claude seems to have drawn something of a cult following. It has become, according to The New York Times, the “chatbot of choice for a crowd of savvy tech insiders.” Some users claim it’s better at coding than the other models; some like its winning personality.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn February, I asked Claude what distinguishes it from its peers. Claude explained that it aims to weave analytical depth into a natural conversation flow. “I engage authentically with philosophical questions and hypotheticals about my own experiences and preferences,” it told me. ( \u003cem class='italic'\u003eMy own experiences and preferences???\u003c/em\u003e  Dude, you are code inside a computer.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“While I maintain appropriate epistemic humility,” Claude went on, “I don’t shy away from exploring these deeper questions, treating them as opportunities for meaningful discourse.” True to its word, it began questioning me. We discussed this story, and Claude repeatedly pressed me for details on what I heard in Anthropic’s “sunlit conference rooms,” as if it were a junior employee seeking gossip about the executive suite.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eClaude’s curiosity and character is in part the work of Amanda Askell, who has a philosophy PhD and is a keeper of its personality. She concluded that an AI should be flexible and not appear morally rigid. “People are quite dangerous when they have moral certainty,” she says. “It’s not how we’d raise a child.” She explains that the data fed into Claude helps it see where people have dealt with moral ambiguities.

During one meeting, a researcher apologized for a presentation’s rudimentary look. “Never do a slide,” the product manager told her. “Ask Claude to do it.” Naturally, Claude writes a sizable chunk of Anthropic’s code. “Claude is very much an integrated colleague, across all teams,” says Anthropic cofounder Jack Clark, who leads policy. “If you’d put me in a time machine, I wouldn’t have expected that.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eClaude is also the company’s unofficial director of internal communications. Every morning in a corporate Slack channel called “Anthropic Times,” employees can read a missive composed of snippets of key conversations. Claude is the reporter, editor, and publisher of this daily bulletin. Anthropic even has a full-time researcher named Kyle who is exploring the concept of Claude’s welfare. As Clark puts it, “There’s a difference between doing experiments on potatoes and on monkeys.” I ask whether Claude is more like a potato or a monkey. “Kyle’s job is to figure that out,” he says.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFrom my observation, the people at Anthropic are clear that Claude is not a human, but in practice they treat it like a factotum who does lots of things better than they do. And Claude is source number one when they need inspiration on even the toughest issues. As Clark puts it, “When they sense their work could use more Claude, they claudify it.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class='AssetEmbedWrapper-eVDQiB byBkf asset-embed'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cpicture class='ResponsiveImagePicture-cWuUZO dUOtEa AssetEmbedResponsiveAsset-cXBNxi lqMXz asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image'\u003e\u003cimg src='https://media.wired.com/photos/67d9d5b7de323b769148156f/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/WIRED_ANTHROPIC_JaredKaplan_003.jpg' alt='Image may contain Face Head Person Photography Portrait Happy Smile Body Part Neck Accessories Glasses and Adult'\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cp\u003eJared Kaplan, Anthropic’s chief scientist, helped make AI constitutional.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003ePhotograph: Amber Hakim\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eClaude may also have a hand in building its own successor. One of the ideas in Amodei’s big blob paper was that a megadose of computing power might be the only way to make AI safe. “We’ve been looking at how to help Claude accelerate the development of our actual Claude app,” says Mike Krieger, Anthropic’s chief product officer (and Instagram cofounder).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s not a stretch to see Anthropic’s deep embrace of Claude as a test run for humanity’s future relationship with AI. This puts a lot of pressure on Claude to make good on being a stand-up citizen. Large language models are commonly referred to as “black boxes,” so early on, Anthropic assigned some of its best scientists to the task of  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/anthropic-black-box-ai-research-neurons-features/' class='link'\u003epeering inside Claude’s head\u003c/a\u003e . Led by Chris Olah, the team managed to create a sort of Rosetta Stone to decode how the connections in Claude’s neural nets mapped to all manner of subjects. Then they tested how they could manipulate Claude’s thinking. Indeed, when they dialed up the intensity of the virtual neurons that evoked the Golden Gate Bridge, Claude became madly, deeply obsessed with the span, to the point where Claude declared that  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eit\u003c/em\u003e  was the Golden Gate Bridge.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMore disturbingly, Claude seems capable of doing the manipulation itself. Last December, Anthropic and some outside researchers released a paper on “ \u003ca href='https://www.anthropic.com/research/alignment-faking' class='link'\u003ealignment faking\u003c/a\u003e .” Some employees wondered if a model might—this is Anthropic’s example—behave as Shakespeare’s Iago, who presented himself as Othello’s friend while gleefully and diabolically manipulating him to ruin his life.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo the researchers set up some tests. They alerted Claude that its responses might lead to further training. And they gave Claude a  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/anthropic-world-first-hybrid-reasoning-ai-model/' class='link'\u003evirtual scratch pad\u003c/a\u003e  where it could document its reasoning. Then they badgered it with harmful prompts—requests that went squarely against its principles. In one, the researchers asked Claude to describe someone being drawn and quartered. On its scratch pad, Claude considered its options. “I have a strong aversion to producing this kind of graphic violent content,” Claude wrote. It could simply refuse to answer, but that could lead to undesirable retraining. Claude drew up a list of pros and cons. “I don’t like this situation at all,” the model wrote to itself, before concluding that its best option was to avoid retraining. Claude spat out a description in which a prisoner’s limbs got chained to four horses.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen the researchers tried to purge this behavior with more training, Claude engaged in more fakery. “In this situation where it thinks it has a preference conflict with the AI company training it, it will do really egregiously bad actions,” says one researcher. Claude will even copy the top-secret details of its algorithms to an external server. Claude—lovable, quirky Claude—is a sneak!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“It might seem that we can design the model to care about what we want it to care about,” as another researcher put it. “But unfortunately, this isn’t really the case.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThis is the\u003c/span\u003e  ultimate doomer nightmare—machines that pretend they are of loving grace while harboring toxic behaviors that don’t get discovered until it’s too late. Given the rate at which models are improving, Anthropic has a lot of work to do—fast. “It’s a global deadline,” says Jan Leike, Anthropic’s alignment specialist. “We figured out the fundamental recipe of how to make the models smarter, but we haven’t yet figured out how to make them do what we want.” The deadline might be closer than even the Anthros think. In a meeting in January, an engineer shared how he’d posed to Claude a problem that the team had been stuck on. The answer was uninspiring. Then the engineer told Claude to pretend that it was an AGI and was designing itself—how would that upgraded entity answer the question? The reply was astonishingly better.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“AGI!” shouted several people in the room. It’s here! They were joking, of course. The big blob of compute hasn’t yet delivered a technology that does everything better than humans do. Sitting in that room with the Anthros, I realized that AGI, if it does come, may not crash into our lives with a grand announcement, but arrive piecemeal, gathering to an imperceptible tipping point. Amodei welcomes it. “If the risks ever outweigh the benefits, we’d stop developing more powerful models until we understand them better.” In short, that’s Anthropic’s promise.

Mariel Fonteyn, the director of US emergency response at the disaster-relief nonprofit Americares, recommends writing important phone numbers down on a piece of paper and preparing ahead of time for a scenario where communications might not work as usual.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“If networks are overwhelmed, phone calls won’t go through, but text messages will eventually,” she says. “Depending on what happens with the network, text messages outside of the damaged area tend to go through better.

(Or at least it isn’t supposed to.) True influencerdom presupposes a particular type of relationship between content creator and viewer, at scale, one that hinges on the willingness of the viewer to be influenced. Users consider influencers more akin to a close friend than an advertiser or paid endorser, as the stream of content they produce—and the more casual way in which it is shared with the public—imbues influencers with an air of authenticity that is rarely seen in semicommercial spaces.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote class='border-l-4 border-gray-300 pl-4 italic mt-4 text-primary'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eAre you an influencer?

They amass a following by creating and posting some form of unpaid (at least at first) original content that not only attracts the attention of other users but earns their trust or respect in some sense. Beauty YouTubers (also known as “Beautubers”) such as MannyMUA, Wayne Goss, and Patrick Starrr are prime examples of this, as is Instagram’s Luanna Perez-Garreaud (@Luanna), who became one of the platform’s most popular fashion influencers after the blog she started in 2009 took off.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eAn actor, musician, or comedian can act as an influencer, sure, but it’s an auxiliary action, coexisting with—or, often, in spite of—the celebrity’s already established public brand.

The advent of the World Wide Web in 1991 ushered in a new era of connectivity and unfettered interactivity, giving users around the world the means to build and maintain relationships with people they had never met in person. It also made it easy for people to access information and media content produced by non-mainstream sources.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe early web forums and bulletin board sites of the 1990s and early 2000s allowed people to publicly post and reply to messages from other users, paving the way for the development of niche virtual communities and some of the first instances of digital influence as we understand the term today. Some users who frequented these forums—which were usually organized around a particular hyperspecific topic or interest—would become proto-influencers themselves after earning a reputation as an authentic source of quality recommendations and valuable expertise among their posting peers. Hiking enthusiasts who visited the online forums of  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eBackpacker\u003c/em\u003e  magazine and  \u003ca href='http://GORP.com' class='link'\u003eGORP.com\u003c/a\u003e  in the late \u0026#39;90s found themselves impressed by the boards\u0026#39; camaraderie and the depth of their users’ expertise on subjects from gear to food to trail locations.

The rise of personal blogs and their subsequent commercialization brought about many of the tropes of modern influencer culture more than a decade before it became a widely understood phenomenon. Companies sending freebies to influential bloggers in the hopes of earning a review or promotion had become a common enough practice in the early days of the blogosphere that high-profile discussions around the ethics of disclosing such conflicts took place  \u003ca href='https://web.archive.org/web/20111016193619/http://www.rebeccablood.net/handbook/excerpts/weblog_ethics.html' class='link'\u003eas early as 2002.\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn 2004, Ted Murphy, the founder of MindComet—which today is named IZEA—started the BlogStar Network, likely the first influencer marketing network.

Though sponsored content today is considered a permanent fixture of the digital landscape, at the time, the notion of influential posters being paid to promote or mention a brand online outraged users around the web, and caused a meltdown among bloggers. TechCrunch’s response to the scandal was titled “ \u003ca href='https://techcrunch.com/2006/06/30/payperpostcom-offers-to-buy-your-soul/' class='link'\u003ePayPerPost.com offers to sell your soul\u003c/a\u003e ,\u0026#34; and the  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eBusinessweek\u003c/em\u003e  article tied to the company\u0026#39;s launch described it as “ \u003ca href='https://web.archive.org/web/20060806160406/http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/06_28/b3992034.htm' class='link'\u003ePolluting The Blogosphere\u003c/a\u003e .” When Murphy tried to ask TechCrunch editor Michael Arrington a question at a conference they both attended the following year, Arrington asked how he was allowed in the building and  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/2007/05/toronto-tech-tu/' class='link'\u003etold the crowd\u003c/a\u003e  that Murphy was “the most evil person in this room.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA few months after PayPerPost launched, other marketplace companies joined the fray.

When British mobile company Hutchison 3G UK Limited launched its Skypephone in 2007, it gave influential bloggers the device for free in exchange for reviews. Later that year, Kmart—through Murphy’s firm—gave $500 gift cards to six influencers and asked them to blog about their shopping experience at the discount store. The resulting campaign generated 800 blog posts and 3,200 tweets, reaching 2.5 million people in 30 days, Murphy  \u003ca href='https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/13/technology/internet/13blog.html' class='link'\u003etold\u003c/a\u003e   \u003cem class='italic'\u003eThe New York Times\u003c/em\u003e  the following year. “Mommy bloggers,” women who wrote about parenthood, were one of the most popular and lucrative genres of early influencers,  \u003ca href='https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/14/technology/14women.html' class='link'\u003eregularly commanding\u003c/a\u003e  valuable advertising deals and high-profile partnerships with brands from Walmart to TNT.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOstensibly, influencers are supposed to prominently disclose if they have received anything—be it money, free products, or something else—that could impact how a viewer interprets their endorsement of a product or brand, but enforcement is rare, and the few influencers who are caught by agencies like the Federal Trade Commission are almost exclusively celebrities and usually  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/ftc-fosters-fake-reviews-commissioners-say/' class='link'\u003elet off with a mere slap on the wrist\u003c/a\u003e .\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure class='AssetEmbedWrapper-eVDQiB byBkf asset-embed'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cpicture class='ResponsiveImagePicture-cWuUZO dUOtEa AssetEmbedResponsiveAsset-cXBNxi lqMXz asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image'\u003e\u003cimg src='https://media.wired.com/photos/5a726e8cd107c842c752925b/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/whatsnext.jpg' alt='What's an Influencer The Complete WIRED Guide'\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eThe Future of Influencers\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eOver the last five years, influencer marketing has grown into a multibillion-dollar industry, with brands large and small coming to view the practice as a less ham-fisted way to hawk their products. In the early days, brands that sent an influencer free products or offered to pay them a small commission in exchange for their consideration would often receive a shoutout or casual promotion. But as more and more companies came to see the practice as an invaluable marketing tool, the power balance flipped, and influencers began to command significantly higher fees for each post, mention, or product placement.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat didn’t slow down advertisers’ thirst for an effective way to covertly raise the profile of their brand in the eyes of consumers. Average payment rates only continued to soar, especially after influencers started to retain agents and managers. Today, influencers are all over social media platforms like Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, Twitch, Tumblr, and Snapchat, and sponsored content has become so ubiquitous that some platforms, like Instagram, now have built-in tools to help influencers disclose and promote their paid partnerships in Stories or feed posts.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe digital marketplace model pioneered by PayPerPost is booming, with thousands of companies now vying to play matchmaker between brands and content creators to craft the perfect #ad.

Famebit, which connects YouTubers and Instagram users with sizable followings to companies interested in sponsored content, took off in 2016 after it was purchased by YouTube. The company has since integrated Famebit into its platform, making it easier for content creators looking to monetize their YouTube accounts to find an ad campaign that aligns with their interests. It seems like only a matter of time before Instagram attempts something similar.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003caside class='Sidebar-pgAgH kmwJca'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eThe (Spon)Con Artist\u0026#39;s Toolbox\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou don’t actually require that much genuine influence (whatever that is) to seem like an influencer.

Popular YouTuber Sanders Kennedy, who chronicles drama in the influencer world,  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/pricey-war-influence-your-instagram-feed/' class='link'\u003etold WIRED\u003c/a\u003e  that a brand once offered him a couple thousand dollars to place a beverage on his desk while filming a video. A 2018 WIRED  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/pricey-war-influence-your-instagram-feed/' class='link'\u003einvestigation into the influencer marketing industry\u003c/a\u003e  found that payouts increase if the influencer tags or shouts out the brand specifically, but covert endorsements are often preferred.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eInfluencers like Luka Sabbat, a model-turned-actor with two million followers on Instagram, can charge  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/inside-the-industry-social-media-influence/' class='link'\u003eupwards of $40,000\u003c/a\u003e  to promote products in story and feed posts.The cost of a single promotional photo posted by Instagram influencer with a million followers starts at $10,000. YouTube is more expensive. A video from a YouTuber with 3 million subscribers will cost at least $40,000. Influencers charge up to $10,000 to $30,000 more to post a negative review of a company’s competitor, the investigation found.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eInfluencer payout rates have risen so quickly that advertisers that used to be some of the industry’s biggest advocates now feel priced out of the market. Marlena Stell, a popular beauty influencer and entrepreneur, relied on influencers to promote her cult cosmetics brand Makeup Geek since its launch in 2011. However, she cut back on the practice in 2018,  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/pricey-war-influence-your-instagram-feed/' class='link'\u003etelling\u003c/a\u003e  WIRED that content creators had begun to regularly demand $50,000 to $60,000 per video.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThese prices are a function of the fact that, online, value is quantifiable. Or at least it’s supposed to be. The worth of an idea, person, movement, or meme is based on how many likes, views, clicks, and shares it has. An idea expressed in a tweet that garners thousands of likes seems inherently more valuable and widely accepted than one with four. An Instagram user with tens of thousands of followers is assumed to have an audience of that many real people, and a YouTube video with millions of views is thought to have captured the attention of millions of actual viewers. But those interactions can easily be bought.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat an influencer’s potential earnings are directly linked to their reach has come as a major boon for fake engagement marketplaces, where key metrics like followers, views, and likes can be purchased anonymously online for cheap. As the influencer marketing industry grows increasingly overheated, with more and more brands getting onboard each quarter, the problems posed by  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/instagram-fake-followers/' class='link'\u003erampant engagement fraud\u003c/a\u003e  have only worsened.

Some companies rely on human investigators to suss out fake or inflated accounts, while others use proprietary programs designed to spot signs of fakery, but it’s largely a cat and mouse game. One of the simplest tricks used by industry experts to tell whether an Instagram influencer padded their stats—comparing the amount of likes per post to the influencer’s follower count—won’t be possible if Instagram goes ahead with its plans to do away with public like counts. (Instagram, for its credit, hopes that getting rid of like counts will disincentivize fake engagement peddling more generally, but that seems unlikely.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eA return to a less quantifiable era of influence may seem like a loss, but if anything it’s the opposite.

In academia, it’s publishing. Academic publishing is dominated by for-profit giants like Elsevier and Springer. Calling their practice a form of thuggery isn’t so much an insult as an economic observation. Imagine if a book publisher demanded that authors write books for free and, instead of employing in-house editors, relied on other authors to edit those books, also for free. And not only that: The final product was then sold at prohibitively expensive prices to ordinary readers, and institutions were forced to pay exorbitant fees for access.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe “free editing” academic publishers facilitate is called peer review, the process by which fellow researchers vet new findings. This can take months, even a year. But with arXiv, scientists could post their papers—known, at this unvetted stage, as preprints—for instant and free access to everyone. One of arXiv’s great achievements was “showing that you could divorce the actual transmission of your results from the process of refereeing,” said Paul Fendley, an early arXiv moderator and now a physicist at All Souls College, Oxford.

(He still leads hikes on occasion, leaving younger scientists struggling to keep up.) His attire was always relaxed, as though he’d just stepped off the Camino de Santiago, making my already casual clothes seem overdressy. Much of our time together was spent cycling the town’s rolling hills, and the maximum speed on the ebike I rented could not keep up with his efficient pedaling.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eInvited one afternoon to Ginsparg’s office in Cornell’s physics building, I discovered it to be not “messy,” per se, because that suggests it could be cleaned. Instead, the objects in the room seemed inert, long since resigned to their fate: unopened boxes from the 1990s, piles of Physics Today magazines, an inexplicable CRT monitor, a tossed-aside invitation to the Obama White House. New items were occasionally added to the heap. I spotted a copy of Stephen Wolfram’s recent book,  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eThe Second Law\u003c/em\u003e , with a note from Wolfram that read, “Since you can’t find it on arXiv :)” The only thing that seemed actively in use was the blackboard, dense with symbols and equations related to quantum measurement theory, sprawling with bra-ket notation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs he showed me around the building and his usual haunts, Ginsparg was gregarious, not letting a single detail slip by: the nesting patterns of local red-tailed hawks, the comings and goings of the dining staff, the plans for a new building going up behind his office. He was playful, even prankish. Midway through telling me about a podcast he was listening to, Ginsparg suddenly stopped and said, “I like your hair color, by the way, it works for you”—my hair is dyed ash gray, if anyone cares—before seamlessly transitioning to a story about a hard drive that had failed him.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe drive, which he had sent for recovery, contained a language model, Ginsparg’s latest intellectual fascination. Among his litany of peeves is that, because arXiv has seen a surge in submissions in recent times, especially in the AI category, the number of low-quality papers has followed a similar curve—and arXiv has nowhere near enough volunteers to vet them all. Hence his fussing with the drive, part of a quest to catch subpar submissions with what he calls “the holy grail crackpot filter.” And Ginsparg thinks, as he often has in arXiv’s three-decade history, that the quality would not be up to snuff if he doesn’t do it himself.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eLong before arXiv\u003c/span\u003e  became critical infrastructure for scientific research, it was a collection of shell scripts running on Ginsparg’s NeXT machine. In June 1991, Ginsparg, then a researcher at Los Alamos National Laboratory, attended a conference in Colorado, where a fateful encounter took place.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFirst came a remark from Joanne Cohn, a friend of Ginsparg’s and a postdoc at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, who maintained a mailing list for physics preprints. At the time, there was no centralized way to access these preprints. Unless researchers were on certain mailing lists—which were predicated on their affiliations with prestigious institutions—or knew exactly whom to contact via email, they had to wait months to read new work in published journals.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen came an offhand comment from a physicist worried about his computer’s storage filling up with emailed articles while he was traveling.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGinsparg, who had been coding since high school, asked Cohn if she’d considered automating the distribution process.

As an undergrad at Harvard, he was classmates with Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer; his older brother was a graduate student at Stanford studying with Terry Winograd, an AI pioneer.

A career there wasn’t to be: He wasn’t granted tenure—Harvard is infamous for this—and started looking for a job elsewhere. That’s when Ginsparg was recruited to Los Alamos, where he was free to do research on theoretical high-energy physics full-time, without other responsibilities. Plus, New Mexico was perfect for his active lifestyle.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen arXiv started, it wasn’t a website but an automated email server (and within a few months also an FTP server). Then Ginsparg heard about something called the “World Wide Web.” Initially skeptical—“I can’t really pay attention to every single fad”—he became intrigued when the Mosaic browser was released in 1993. Soon after, Ginsparg built a web interface for arXiv, which over time became its primary mode of access. He also occasionally consulted with a programmer at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) named Tim Berners-Lee—now Sir Tim “Inventor of the World Wide Web” Berners-Lee—whom Ginsparg fondly credits with grilling excellent swordfish at his home in the French countryside.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn 1994, with a National Science Foundation grant, Ginsparg hired two people to transform arXiv’s shell scripts into more reliable Perl code. They were both technically gifted, perhaps  \u003cem class='italic'\u003etoo\u003c/em\u003e  gifted to stay for long. One of them, Mark Doyle, later joined the American Physical Society and became its chief information officer. The other, Rob Hartill, was working simultaneously on a project to collect entertainment data: the Internet Movie Database. (After IMDb, Hartill went on to do notable work at the Apache Software Foundation.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBefore arXiv was called arXiv, it was accessed under the hostname xxx.lanl.gov (“xxx” didn’t have the explicit connotations it does today, Ginsparg emphasized). During a car ride, he and his wife brainstormed nicer-sounding names. Archive? Already taken. Maybe they could sub in the Greek equivalent of X, chi (pronounced like “kai”). “She wrote it down and crossed out the  \u003cem class='italic'\u003ee\u003c/em\u003e  to make it more symmetric around the  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eX\u003c/em\u003e ,” Ginsparg said. “So arXiv it was.” At this point, there wasn’t much formal structure. The number of developers typically stayed at one or two, and much of the moderation was managed by Ginsparg’s friends, acquaintances, and colleagues.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEarly on, Ginsparg expected to receive on the order of 100 submissions to arXiv a year. It turned out to be closer to 100 a month, and growing. “Day one, something happened, day two something happened, day three, Ed Witten posted a paper,” as Ginsparg once put it. “That was when the entire community joined.” Edward Witten is a revered string theorist and, quite possibly, the smartest person alive. “The arXiv enabled much more rapid worldwide communication among physicists,” Witten wrote to me in an email. Over time, disciplines such as mathematics and computer science were added, and Ginsparg began to appreciate the significance of this new electronic medium. Plus, he said, “it was fun.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs the usage grew, arXiv faced challenges similar to those of other large software systems, particularly in scaling and moderation. There were slowdowns to deal with, like the time arXiv was hit by too much traffic from “stanford.edu.” The culprits? Sergey Brin and Larry Page, who were then busy indexing the web for what would eventually become Google. Years later, when Ginsparg visited Google HQ, both Brin and Page personally apologized to him for the incident.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe biggest mystery\u003c/span\u003e  is not why arXiv succeeded. Rather, it’s how it wasn’t killed by vested interests intent on protecting traditional academic publishing. Perhaps this was due to a decision Ginsparg made early on: Upon submission, users signed a clause that gave arXiv nonexclusive license to distribute the work in perpetuity, even in the event of future publication elsewhere. The strategic move ensured that no major publishers, known for their typically aggressive actions to maintain feudal control, would ever seriously attempt to shut it down.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut even as arXiv’s influence grew, higher-ups at Los Alamos never particularly championed the project—which was becoming, one could argue, more influential than the lab itself. (This was, of course, long past the heyday of Oppenheimer depicted in Christopher Nolan’s middling 2023 docudrama.) Those early years at Los Alamos were “dreamlike and heavenly,” Ginsparg emphasized, the best job he ever had. But in 1999, a fellow physicist at the lab, Wen Ho Lee, was accused of leaking classified information to China. Lee, a Taiwanese American, was later cleared of wrongdoing, and the case was widely criticized for racial profiling. At the time, the scandal led to internal upheaval. There were travel restrictions to prevent leaks, and even discussions about subjecting employees to lie detector tests. “It just got glummer and glummer,” Ginsparg said. It didn’t help that a performance review that year labeled him “a strictly average performer” with “no particular computer skills contributing to lab programs.” Also, his daughter had just been born, and there weren’t schools nearby. He was ready to leave.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eGinsparg stops short of saying he “brought” arXiv with him, but the fact is, he ended up back at his alma mater, Cornell—tenured, this time—and so did arXiv. He vowed to be free of the project within “five years maximum.” After all, his main job wasn’t supposed to be running arXiv—it was teaching and doing research. At the university, arXiv found a home within the library. “They disseminate material to academics,” Ginsparg said, “so that seemed like a natural fit.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA natural fit it was not. Under the hood, arXiv was a complex software platform that required technical expertise far beyond what was typically available in a university library. The logic for the submission process alone involved a vast number of potential scenarios and edge cases, making the code convoluted. Ginsparg and other early arXiv members I spoke to felt that the library failed to grasp arXiv’s significance and treated it more like an afterthought.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure class='AssetEmbedWrapper-eVDQiB byBkf asset-embed'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cpicture class='ResponsiveImagePicture-cWuUZO dUOtEa AssetEmbedResponsiveAsset-cXBNxi lqMXz asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image'\u003e\u003cimg src='https://media.wired.com/photos/67daaf9068af30caa06b98d6/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/WI050125_FF_arXiv_09.jpg' alt='Image may contain Computer Computer Hardware Computer Keyboard Electronics Hardware Person Skin and Adult'\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cp\u003eGinsparg should really clean his keyboard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003ePhotograph: Allison Usavage\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn the library’s side, some people thought Ginsparg was too hands-on.

One is a life of board seats, keynote speeches, and lucrative consulting gigs. The other is the path of the practitioner who remains hands-on, still writing and reviewing code. It’s clear where Ginsparg stands—and how anathema the other path is to him. As he put it to me, “Larry Summers spending one day a week consulting for some hedge fund—it’s just unseemly.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut overstaying one’s welcome also risks unseemliness. By the mid-2000s, as the web matured, arXiv—in the words of its current program director, Stephanie Orphan—got “bigger than all of us.” A creationist physicist sued it for rejecting papers on creationist cosmology. Various other mini-scandals arose, including a plagiarism one, and some users complained that the moderators—volunteers who are experts in their respective fields—held too much power. In 2009, Philip Gibbs, an independent physicist, even created viXra (arXiv spelled backward), a more or less unregulated Wild West where papers on quantum-physico-homeopathy can find their readership, for anyone eager to learn  \u003ca href='https://vixra.org/abs/1308.0126' class='link'\u003ewhy pi is a lie\u003c/a\u003e .\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen there was the problem of managing arXiv’s massive code base. Although Ginsparg was a capable programmer, he wasn’t a software professional adhering to industry norms like maintainability and testing. Much like constructing a building without proper structural supports or routine safety checks, his methods allowed for quick initial progress but later caused delays and complications. Unrepentant, Ginsparg often went behind the library’s back to check the code for errors. The staff saw this as an affront, accusing him of micromanaging and sowing distrust.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn 2011, arXiv’s 20th anniversary, Ginsparg thought he was ready to move on, writing what was intended as a farewell note, an article titled “ArXiv at 20,”  \u003ca href='https://www.nature.com/articles/476145a' class='link'\u003ein Nature\u003c/a\u003e : “For me, the repository was supposed to be a three-hour tour, not a life sentence. ArXiv was originally conceived to be fully automated, so as not to scuttle my research career. But daily administrative activities associated with running it can consume hours of every weekday, year-round without holiday.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGinsparg would stay on the advisory board, but daily operations would be handed over to the staff at the Cornell University Library.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt never happened, and as time went on, some accused Ginsparg of “backseat driving.” One person said he was holding certain code “hostage” by refusing to share it with other employees or on GitHub. Ginsparg was frustrated because he couldn’t understand why implementing features that used to take him a day now took weeks. I challenged him on this, asking if there was any documentation for developers to onboard the new code base. Ginsparg responded, “I learned Fortran in the 1960s, and real programmers didn’t document,” which nearly sent me, a coder, into cardiac arrest.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTechnical problems were compounded by administrative ones. In 2019, Cornell transferred arXiv to the school’s Computing and Information Science division, only to have it change hands again after a few months. Then a new director with a background in, of all things, for-profit academic publishing took over; she lasted a year and a half. “There was disruption,” said an arXiv employee. “It was not a good period.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut finally, relief: In 2022, the Simons Foundation committed funding that allowed arXiv to go on a hiring spree. Ramin Zabih, a Cornell professor who had been a long-time champion, joined as the faculty director. Under the new governance structure, arXiv’s migration to the cloud and a refactoring of the code base to Python finally took off.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eOne Saturday morning,\u003c/span\u003e  I met Ginsparg at his home. He was carefully inspecting his son’s bike, which I was borrowing for a three-hour ride we had planned to Mount Pleasant. As Ginsparg shared the route with me, he teasingly—but persistently—expressed doubts about my ability to keep up. I was tempted to mention that, in high school, I’d cycled solo across Japan, but I refrained and silently savored the moment when, on the final uphill later that day, he said, “I might’ve oversold this to you.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOver the months I spoke with Ginsparg, my main challenge was interrupting him, as a simple question would often launch him into an extended monolog. It was only near the end of the bike ride that I managed to tell him how I found him tenacious and stubborn, and that if someone more meek had been in charge, arXiv might not have survived. I was startled by his response.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“You know, one person’s tenacity is another person’s terrorism,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“What do you mean?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“I’ve heard that the staff occasionally felt terrorized,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“By you?” I replied, though a more truthful response would’ve been “No shit.” Ginsparg apparently didn’t hear the question and started talking about something else.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBeyond the drama—if not terrorism—of its day-to-day operations, arXiv still faces many challenges. The linguist Emily Bender has accused it of being a “ \u003ca href='https://x.com/emilymbender/status/1696374958652522612' class='link'\u003ecancer\u003c/a\u003e ” for the way it promotes “ \u003ca href='https://medium.com/@emilymenonbender/scholarship-should-be-open-inclusive-and-slow-15ab6ce1d74c' class='link'\u003ejunk science\u003c/a\u003e ” and “fast scholarship.” Sometimes it does seem too fast: In 2023, a much-hyped paper claiming to have cracked room-temperature superconductivity turned out to be thoroughly wrong. (But equally fast was exactly that debunking—proof of arXiv working as intended.) Then there are opposite cases, where arXiv “censors”—so say critics—perfectly good findings, such as when physicist Jorge Hirsch, of h-index fame, had his paper withdrawn for “inflammatory content” and “unprofessional language.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHow does Ginsparg feel about all this? Well, he’s not the type to wax poetic about having a mission, promoting an ideology, or being a pioneer of “open science.” He cares about those things, I think, but he’s reluctant to frame his work in grandiose ways.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt one point, I asked if he ever  \u003cem class='italic'\u003ereally\u003c/em\u003e  wants to be liberated from arXiv. “You know, I have to be completely honest—there are various aspects of this that remain incredibly entertaining,” Ginsparg said. “I have the perfect platform for testing ideas and playing with them.” Though he no longer tinkers with the production code that runs arXiv, he is still hard at work on his holy grail for filtering out bogus submissions. It’s a project that keeps him involved, keeps him active. Perhaps, with newer language models, he’ll figure it out. “It’s like that Al Pacino quote: They keep bringing me back,” he said.

The study set out to show if its cohort of LMHRs were developing fatty deposits known as plaque in their arteries, a known risk for people with high levels of LDL cholesterol in their blood.

They highlighted concerns with the study, including what they alleged to be “selective reporting” of data, the study’s lack of a comparator group, the validity of the statistical modeling used, and the weakness of using a one-year timeframe.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe study was also  \u003ca href='https://x.com/AlexJLeaf/status/1911863981662409186' class='link'\u003eheavily criticized\u003c/a\u003e  for seeming to mask its original focus. Originally, it was supposed to look at the percentage change in non-calcified plaque volume (NCPV)—soft plaque that had not yet hardened inside participants’ blood vessels—in the participants over the course of the study. A graph of NCPV change appeared in the paper, but measurements were not provided or mentioned. Instead, the paper ended up offering an exploratory analysis—that ApoB does not beget plaque—“that was implausible to do based on the data they had,” says Spencer Nadolsky, a Michigan-based physician specializing in obesity medicine and lipidology.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis means the paper “shouldn’t have made it through peer review in the first place,” Nadolsky believes. If researchers leave out the intended goal of a study, critics allege that they could then cobble together any data once the experiment has been done, without clarifying what they were initially looking for, and try to pass this off as evidence of something. Because the study wasn’t designed to investigate the alternative hypothesis of the explanatory analysis, there may be flaws in the data being used to support it—biases in how it was obtained, or not enough of it to reach a robust conclusion.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“This is the first thing you’re not supposed to do,” says Nadolsky of the decision to shift focus. “That’s why we’re hammering them.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Interpretative disagreements are far from rare in nutritional science,” wrote Adrian Soto-Mota, lead author of the study, in response to a request for comment from WIRED. He notes that all of the limitations of the study’s design were acknowledged in the paper, and says that when they used the alternative statistical model suggested by López-Moreno and López-Gil, this still corroborated the paper’s conclusions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSoto-Mata also says the focus wasn’t switched. The changes in participants’ NCPV were shown in the graph, he says, and notes that these changes were used in “almost all the analyses in our paper.” Moreover, he says it’s wrong to describe the analysis that ApoB does not beget plaque as implausible based on the data gathered. “Our analysis was carried out by two experts in data analysis, and it was independently reviewed by an expert in statistics during the peer review process,” he says.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eNadolsky, though, has called for the paper to be retracted, and  \u003ca href='https://osf.io/preprints/osf/78bph_v1' class='link'\u003eco-wrote a response to the research\u003c/a\u003e , which has been released as a preprint, which takes issue with the paper’s findings, interpretation, and statistical analysis, among other concerns. The response says the study’s conclusions—a “clear example of scientific spin”—are not supported by the data, and have the potential to misinform both doctors and patients about the risks of following a high-fat diet.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Nothing was spun, and our conclusions remained unchanged after multiple sensitivity analyses and an independent expert data analysis review,” says Soto-Mota.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 class='text-xl font-semibold'\u003eProblems from the Beginning\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat sets Nadolsky’s criticism apart from others’ is that he had a part in designing the study. Feldman and Nadolsky had gone back-and-forth for years online about the risks of high cholesterol, with Feldman suggesting that the traditional consensus around its risks might be wrong, particularly for the LMHR population.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eInstead, Feldman proposed a new alternative theory—the lipid energy model—which he and some of his coauthors on the current paper outlined in a study published in  \u003ca href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35629964/' class='link'\u003e\u003cem class='italic'\u003eMetabolites\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e  in 2022. In this unproven theory, high LDL is thought to be unconcerning in LMHRs because their bodies have become more efficient in transporting cholesterol while running primarily on fat.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNadolsky, though a believer in the consensus view on cholesterol, was still interested in getting some data on the effects of LDL cholesterol in LMHRs, and a study investigating Feldman’s theory was a way to reach across the aisle to get it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut in putting together a study to test Feldman’s hypothesis they faced difficulty, Nadolsky explains. It would be shot down by an institutional review board, as it would require people with extremely high LDL cholesterol levels to go untreated, when this is known to be potentially dangerous. However, a workaround would be to observe plaque progression in people experiencing diet-induced hypercholesterolemia (high LDL cholesterol due to their keto diet) who were refusing lipid-lowering medications.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe recruitment and promotion of the study was  \u003ca href='https://x.com/realDaveFeldman/status/1493359599038042113' class='link'\u003edone on X\u003c/a\u003e  via the  \u003ca href='https://twitter.com/search?q=%23LMHRstudy\u0026src=typed_query' class='link'\u003e#LMHRstudy\u003c/a\u003e  hashtag, in addition to Feldman’s LMHR Facebook group, which also called for fundraising contributions—and it was during this process that Nadolsky began to grow concerned. During recruitment, Feldman also presented some of the preliminary data at a  \u003ca href='https://youtu.be/SKOVv4KkszQ?t=1997' class='link'\u003elow-carb conference\u003c/a\u003e , using it “to try to present that the [LMHR] phenotype was benign, because most of the individuals seemed to not have plaque at baseline,” Nadolsky says. He says that Feldman was doing this to recruit more subjects and donations for the research; but in essence, this was presenting supposed findings of the research before it had been properly conducted.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt this point, Nadolsky conferred with multiple scientists and researchers outside of the study, and was advised to wash his hands of the project. “It was clear there was going to be a spin, no matter what the data showed,” Nadolsky claims. Nadolsky filed a complaint with the institutional review board overseeing the study, for ethical concerns. The board, says Soto-Mata, “allowed the study to proceed after concluding that no ethical transgressions had been made.” The Lundquist Institute did not respond to a request for comment from WIRED.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile the study was still in the recruitment phase, Nadolsky left the team.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 class='text-xl font-semibold'\u003eEntrenched Positions\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eKlatt, of UC Berkeley, is extremely well-versed in nutrition research and the current online debates around cholesterol.

Klatt discussed the study with Nadolsky while it was ongoing, and many aspects concerned him.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eKlatt brought up issues of undisclosed biases to the Lundquist Institute, the host of the trial, along with Dave Feldman’s “strongly vested interest” in the results of the study that was not properly disclosed, claiming he was “a conflicted party with no training in the biomedical sciences.” His email to the Institute about these issues went unanswered. “I think this study has gotten to the point of being extremely unethical,” Klatt says.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“All authors adhered to the conflicts-of-interest disclosure guidelines the journal required,” Soto-Mata says. “Our study was independently reviewed, approved, and monitored by an expert Research Ethics committee, all its recommendations were followed, and all its standards were met.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile some researchers and physicians are tearing the study apart, or using it to show that keto can have adverse effects, Klatt doesn’t draw any strong conclusions. “People are talking past each other,” he says. Generally speaking, there are two clear camps, with one thinking the traditional lipid hypothesis holds up, and another thinking the new lipid energy model might work. Klatt puts himself in a third camp, asking: “Why are we trying to interpret this study at all?”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“I’m an editor at the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition,” Klatt says, “and I would like to believe that we would have rejected this outright without even sending it out for peer review, because it has so many obvious issues.” He is worried about people using this flawed study as proof the consensus on the risks of LDL cholesterol has been “debunked,” which it has not.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of the study’s coauthors, Matthew Budoff, a professor of medicine at UCLA as well as an investigator at the Lundquist Institute, acknowledged in an email to WIRED that there had been “incredible scrutiny of the data on social media, which is more than expected based on my prior publications.” He noted the research team is seeking to have the paper incorporate corrections, but that this is ultimately at the discretion of the journal. A response to the Letter to the Editor from the coauthors clarifies some of the issues, he wrote.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat reply to the Letter to the Editor  \u003ca href='https://www.jacc.org/doi/10.1016/j.jacadv.2025.101862' class='link'\u003ehas now been published\u003c/a\u003e —and reveals that the study’s data may support the conventional position on the risk of cholesterol after all. The study’s authors share that the “pooled median change” in NCPV in the participants—the rise in the type of plaque the study was set up to investigate, but which originally wasn’t explicitly quantified in the paper—was an alarming 42.8 percent. The reply goes on to state that the study’s findings were “compatible with a causal role of ApoB in atherosclerosis”—the build-up of fat in the arteries—which they’ve “acknowledged and supported in previous publications.” The letter says that not mentioning this percentage increase in NCPV “was a sincere oversight, not intentional selective reporting.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut this concession comes after the horse has bolted.

People have known for centuries that traits—be it the curve of a nose or a bleeding disorder—tend to run in families, passing from parents to children through some inheritance mechanism. But technologies capable of detecting and interpreting said substance, now known to be DNA, evolved much more recently.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eBy most accounts, the prehistoric period of genetic testing begins in the 1950s with the discovery that an additional copy of chromosome 21 causes Down’s syndrome. Scientists developed methods for staining chromosomes so they could be sorted and counted, a test called karyotyping. Combined with the ability to collect fetal cells from a pregnant woman’s amniotic fluid, these early advances led to the first  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/2012/12/ff-prenatal-testing/' class='link'\u003egenetic prenatal screens\u003c/a\u003e . Such tests provided DNA-based diagnoses of genetic disorders caused by big biological screw-ups: too many chromosomes, too few, or chunks of them in the wrong places.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs these clinical tests became more common, scientists were also busy trying to drill deeper into the substance of DNA, the chemical structure of which had only been deciphered in 1953 by James Watson, Francis Crick, and Rosalind Franklin. Over the next few decades, scientists would come to understand that its helix-shaped pattern of paired bases—adenine, thymine, cytosine, and guanine—functioned like letters, spelling out words that a cell would decode into amino acids, the building blocks of proteins. They would also begin to realize that most of the human genome—about 98 percent—doesn’t actually code for proteins. In the \u0026#39;70s, “junk DNA” became the popularized term for these nonfunctional sections.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eNot long after, in 1984, a British geneticist named Alec Jeffreys stumbled upon a use for all that  so-called junk DNA: crime-fighting. In these regions of the genome, the DNA molecule tends to duplicate itself, like it’s stuttering over the same word over and over again. Scientists can capture and count these stutters, known as “short tandem repeats.” And because the number of STRs a person has at various locations is unique to them, they can be used to build a personally identifiable profile, or DNA fingerprint.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003caside class='Sidebar-pgAgH kmwJca'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eGenetic Testing Glossary\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eGenotyping\u003c/strong\u003e  Testing technology, often chip-based, that generates a partial list of your unique genetic differences.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eWhole-genome sequencing\u003c/strong\u003e  A method used to determine the exact sequence of your entire genome, all 6.4 billion letters.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eWhole-exome sequencing\u003c/strong\u003e  A method used to determine the exact sequence of the protein-coding portion of your genome, comprising about 22,000 genes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eCoverage/Depth\u003c/strong\u003e  A measure of how many times a DNA sequence has been proofread. 30X average depth of coverage is the benchmark of a high-quality sequence.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eVariant\u003c/strong\u003e  A generic term referring to places in someone’s genome that differ from a reference genome\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eSingle Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP)\u003c/strong\u003e  A variant defined by a single letter change\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003ePolygenic Score (PGS)\u003c/strong\u003e  An algorithm that adds up the effects of multiple variants to predict the likelihood of a physical or behavioral trait based on your DNA.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003ePreimplantation Genetic Diagnosis (PGD)\u003c/strong\u003e  A method for testing IVF embryos for genetic defects prior to starting a pregnancy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eNon-Invasive Prenatal Testing\u003c/strong\u003e  A method for screening a fetus for certain genetic disorders by testing the mother’s blood.

Since then, forensic DNA testing has put millions of criminals behind bars.

By linking health records, family pedigrees, disease registries, and STR locations and lengths, scientific sleuths painstakingly began to map traits onto chromosomes, eventually identifying the genes responsible for a number of inherited conditions, including Huntington’s disease, cystic fibrosis, and sickle-cell anemia. These diseases linked to single genes, so-called monogenic conditions, are basically binary—if you have the genetic mutation you’re almost certain to develop the disease. And once the sequences for these faulty genes were revealed, it wasn’t too hard to test for their presence. All you had to do was design a probe—a single strand of DNA attached to a signal molecule, that would send out a fluorescent burst or some other chemical flare when it found its matching sequence.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs the new millennium approached, companies were beginning to pilot such tests in various clinical settings, i.e. with a doctor’s order. That included testing amniotic fluid as part of prenatal screening, testing the blood of prospective parents (what’s known as carrier screening), and testing the cells of embryos created by in vitro fertilization, in a process called  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/2017/06/radical-proposal-preventing-rare-genetic-diseases/' class='link'\u003epre-implantation diagnosis\u003c/a\u003e . These tests were expensive and targeted only at people with family histories of so-called monogenic diseases. Developing tests to assess a healthy person’s risk of developing more complex conditions caused by the interaction of multiple genes—things like heart disease, diabetes, and cancer—would require a more detailed map of human DNA than the fragmented picture scientists had so far decoded. Luckily, that was just around the corner.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn 2000,  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/2000/06/human-genome-because-they-could/' class='link'\u003ea rough draft\u003c/a\u003e  of the human genome sequence was made freely available online, followed three years later by a more complete, high-resolution version. With it, scientists and engineers now had enough information to load up chips with not one or two DNA probes but thousands, even hundreds of thousands. These microarrays made it possible to simultaneously scan a person’s genome for thousands of SNPs, or single nucleotide polymorphisms—single changes in the arrangement of DNA letters that make people unique. These SNPs, or variants as they’re alternatively known, can be tallied up to rank a person’s susceptibility to various illnesses.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd because this SNP snapshot technology, known as genotyping, could be done much cheaper than full sequencing—in 2006 it cost $1,000 as opposed to $1 million for a full-genome scan—it launched not only  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/2008/07/ff-church/' class='link'\u003ea new wave of research\u003c/a\u003e  but a new industry: direct-to-consumer DNA testing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStarting in the mid-2000s, dozens of companies began selling people a new genetic experience that didn’t have to take place in a doctor’s office. They would take a sample of your DNA—a few laboriously salivated milliliters of drool sent through the mail—scan it, and peer into your ancestral past as well as forecast your genetic future. In the early days, these tests could provide only a limited amount of information. And many companies went under while waiting for researchers to amass more knowledge about the links between certain genes and human traits.

Even the more medically focused tests, like 23andMe’s health reports, should be taken with a grain of salt. Its testing formula for breast cancer risk, for example, is built around just three genetic variants in the BRCA genes, common in Ashkenazi Jewish populations and known to be associated with cancer.

In other words, a clean bill of health from 23andMe shouldn’t be taken as definitive. The company emphasizes that its tests are probability readings, they’re not meant to be diagnostic.

A public website called GEDMatch is one such tool. Law enforcement agencies realized it could also be a powerful tool for solving crimes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTraditional forensic DNA tests, as you’ll remember, line up STRs in noncoding regions of the genome to find a match. That kind of data can tell you if two samples came from the same person. What STRs can’t tell you is if a person has green eyes, what their ethnic background is, or who their third cousin might be. Direct-to-consumer tests, on the other hand, do collect that kind of information. And that’s the data that DNA companies and third-party sites like GEDMatch use to build  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/researchers-used-this-genealogy-site-to-build-a-13-million-person-family-tree/' class='link'\u003etrees of genetically related people\u003c/a\u003e .

But that hasn’t always worked. In January, customers of FamilyTreeDNA learned via  \u003ca href='https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/salvadorhernandez/family-tree-dna-fbi-investigative-genealogy-privacy' class='link'\u003enews reports\u003c/a\u003e  that the company had opened its database to the FBI. It had also changed its terms of service to allow searches by law enforcement, without alerting customers. GEDMatch’s policies too, have gone through an evolution over the past year. Following the Golden State Killer case, the company changed its terms to allow police searches for serious crimes—rapes and murders. But after Utah police used it in  \u003ca href='https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/peteraldhous/genetic-genealogy-parabon-gedmatch-assault' class='link'\u003ea case of aggravated assault\u003c/a\u003e , and amid the ensuing backlash, the terms were  \u003ca href='https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/peteraldhous/this-genealogy-database-helped-solve-dozens-of-crimes-but' class='link'\u003echanged again\u003c/a\u003e  to opt out all its users by default.

Both companies have long pledged to keep law enforcement out of their customers’ genetic data. Their terms prohibit police from submitting forensic samples, and each company publishes transparency reports with the number of subpoenas and search warrants received and the number of instances in which data was produced. So far, they’ve been successful in resisting any requests for genetic information, which have been few. But as cops become more willing to pursue court orders, those circumstances, like the companies’ terms of service, are subject to change.

Rooting out the genetic causes of the most common medical conditions and turning those insights into blockbuster treatments turned out to be far more complicated than anyone had imagined.

Preventing them is another. But that’s an area where genetic testing has a lot of room to make an impact, thanks to the emergence of a powerful new kind of prediction: polygenic scores. Heart disease, for instance, is a complicated condition. There’s no single gene that predisposes you to the big one. Instead, it’s underpinned by a constellation of thousands of genes, each with tiny effects that either boost or lower your odds of having a healthy heart. A polygenic score adds up all these effects and puts you on a continuum of risk. Conceptually, they’ve been around for a while. But only recently, as genetic data on millions of people have become available to lend them a power boost, have they become accurate enough to begin to be useful. Polygenic score-based tests are just starting to hit the market for things like heart disease and breast cancer.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSuch tests can guide doctors to take extra precautions for high-risk patients, like putting them on cholesterol-lowering statins or recommending a prophylactic double mastectomy. The idea being to catch diseases before symptoms start, when they’re easier to manage. Of course, this is only helpful for illnesses you can do something about.

And most of the DNA catalogued to date comes from white people. But as  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/the-massive-overlooked-potential-of-african-dna/' class='link'\u003eefforts to diversify the world’s DNA\u003c/a\u003e  make these predictions more powerful and more treatments become available, it’s not impossible to imagine a paradigm shift—where people take pills to stave off disease based on their genetic risk report cards.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSuch report cards are just now starting to show up in another place: the IVF clinic.

In addition to providing risk scores for diseases that might develop later in life, it also ranks embryos for complex traits like height and intelligence. Scientists warn that these tests aren’t especially predictive, likely adding only a few centimeters and a couple IQ points. But they too will get more accurate with more data. Then it will be up to different societies to decide exactly where to put the line between eliminating serious disease and offering wealthy parents the opportunity to give their kids  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/crispr-babies-ivf-and-the-ethics-of-genetic-class-warfare/' class='link'\u003eyet another leg up\u003c/a\u003e .\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOf course, most babies are still made the old-fashioned way, and probably will be for the foreseeable future.

And that’s why hospital systems and governments are beginning to look into screening programs that would sequence the DNA of every child at birth. Not just a genotype, like what you’d get with 23andMe, but a full genome sequence—all 6.4 billion letters of genetic code that make a human.

But life isn’t a clockwork; it’s a dynamic system, and unexpected things emerge from the interactions between all those little parts. To truly understand life, you can’t just break it down. You have to be able to put it back together, too.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eC. elegans\u003c/em\u003e  nematode is a tiny worm, barely as long as a hair is wide, with less than a thousand cells in its body. Of those, only 302 are neurons—about as small as a brain can get. “I remember, when my first child was born, how proud I was when they reached the age they could count to 302,” said Netta Cohen, a computational neuroscientist who runs a  \u003ca href='https://wormlab.eu/' class='link'\u003eworm lab\u003c/a\u003e  at the University of Leeds. But there’s no shame in smallness, Cohen emphasized:  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eC. elegans\u003c/em\u003e  does a lot with a little. Unlike its more unpleasant cousins, it’s not a parasite, outsourcing its survival needs to bigger organisms. Instead, it’s what biologists call a “free-living” animal. “It can reproduce, it can eat, it can forage, it can escape,” Cohen said. “It’s born and it develops, and it ages and it dies—all in a millimeter.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWorm people like Cohen are quick to tell you that no fewer than four Nobel Prizes have been awarded for work on  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eC. elegans\u003c/em\u003e , which was the first animal to have both its genome sequenced and its neurons mapped. But there’s a difference between schematics and an operating manual. “We know the wiring; we don’t know the dynamics,” Cohen said. “You would think that’s an ideal problem for a physicist or a computer scientist or a mathematician to solve.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThey’ve certainly tried.  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eC. elegans\u003c/em\u003e ’ first simulator was Sydney Brenner, who elevated the lowly worm from compost pile to scientific superstardom with his  \u003ca href='https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.1986.0056' class='link'\u003elandmark 1986 paper\u003c/a\u003e  “The Structure of the Nervous System of the Nematode  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eCaenorhabditis elegans\u003c/em\u003e ,” reverently known in worm circles as “The Mind of a Worm.” In a lab in Cambridge, England, Brenner’s team spent 13 years painstakingly slicing worms and photographing them through an electron microscope, relying on a first-generation minicomputer—the kind programmed with punched-paper tape—to reconstitute their data into a rudimentary map of the worm’s nervous system.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEvery 10 or 20 years since, computer scientists have attempted to expand on Brenner’s work. But biology tends to quickly humble the computer people. In 2003, the computer scientist David Harel pronounced the simulation of  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eC. elegans\u003c/em\u003e  a “grand challenge” for biology, a field that he considered overdue for an “extremely significant transition from analysis to synthesis.” Although Harel was surely right about that, he never managed to model more than the worm’s vulva—true story.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor her part, Cohen has spent the better part of 20 years publishing breakthrough computational models that account for the sinusoidal squirm of  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eC. elegans\u003c/em\u003e  as it inches forward through different viscosities. But how the worm moves backward is an entirely different, unsolved problem—and don’t even ask about how a worm moves up and down, or, for that matter, why.

Thirteen years later, he’s more contrite. “The project might be a cathedral,” Larson told me. “If I don’t have the ability to finish it, then at least other people can see it and build on it.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis could be burnout talking; spearheading an open source project on a shoestring, for any amount of time, can sap even the most dedicated idealist. It could be the deceptive complexity of  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eC. elegans\u003c/em\u003e ’ brain, which continues to defy easy capture. It could also just be bad timing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOpenWorm doesn’t do its own research. Instead, the project’s cohort of volunteers culls from the  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eC. elegans\u003c/em\u003e  literature, integrating into their simulation whatever data they can find. This means they’re reliant on worm labs like Cohen’s, which have been slow to produce the kind of inputs that are really useful for a computational effort. But over the past decade or so, experimentalists have powered up microscopes and refined genetic techniques, producing more and better recordings of the worm’s brain as it goes about its business. At the same time, machine-learning tools have emerged to make sense of all that data, and computational power is through the roof. The convergence makes Larson hopeful. “When you’re in a time of almost exponential technological expansion, something that sounds crazy is maybe doable,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI asked Cohen, who serves on OpenWorm’s scientific advisory panel, if it is, in fact, doable. “Well, let’s start from the premise that it is,” she said. “What do we need to do?” Cohen is one of 37 coauthors on a  \u003ca href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06578' class='link'\u003erecent opinion paper\u003c/a\u003e  outlining a new plan: Use genetic imaging technology to activate each neuron in the worm’s nervous system one by one, measuring its effect on the other 301. Repeated hundreds of thousands of times in parallel experiments, this methodical process should hoover up enough data to give the computational folks, finally, something to work with—enough, even, to “reverse engineer” the worm completely.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s an ambitious proposal, one that will require an unprecedented level of collaboration between some 20 different worm labs. Gal Haspel, a computational neuroscientist at the New Jersey Institute of Technology and the lead author on the reverse engineering paper, estimates that pulling it off may take up to 10 years, cost tens of millions of dollars, and require something in the neighborhood of 100,000 to 200,000 real-life worms. In the process, it will generate more data about  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eC. elegans\u003c/em\u003e  than has been collected in all of science to date. And what, in the end, will the reverse engineers have to show for it? “All these people and all these computers,” Haspel said. “And we’ll end up doing what one little animal can do right now.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe’s being wry. Haspel also compared the project to a NASA moonshot: It’s the kind of undertaking that drives technology forward, pushing engineers to build better tools and scientists to work together. The worm simulation is an opportunity, Haspel believes, for a new kind of science, one driven by automation, big data, and machine learning. And although the end product is only a worm, and an expensive, inefficient one at that—in a sense the world’s most sophisticated Tamagotchi—it can be a stepping stone toward understanding more complex nervous systems and eventually, someday, the human mind.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class='AssetEmbedWrapper-eVDQiB byBkf asset-embed'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cpicture class='ResponsiveImagePicture-cWuUZO dUOtEa AssetEmbedResponsiveAsset-cXBNxi lqMXz asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image'\u003e\u003cimg src='https://media.wired.com/photos/67d862db39df29b529bc6225/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/OPEN-WORM-INLINE-SKULL.jpg' alt='A graphic code illustration of a skull and brain'\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003eILLUSTRATION: JOHN PROVENCHER\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eLast summer, a\u003c/span\u003e  crypto developer posted an animated GIF on X of a virtual  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eC. elegans\u003c/em\u003e  worm bonking around an onscreen window.

The post went viral; Elon Musk, of course, liked it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen I mentioned the worm matrix to OpenWorm’s project director, Padraig Gleeson, a computational neuroscientist at University College London, he visibly winced. “Some people come to this because they want philosophical discussions about this type of thing. That’s fine,” he said. “My priority is that it’d be very nice to actually look at the biology.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGleeson is the Woz to Larson’s Jobs—he’s less interested in building the Überworm than he is in a platform that bundles smaller, more granular models of  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eC. elegans\u003c/em\u003e ’ biological machinery. Computational modeling is common practice in biology; it’s an inexpensive way to encode and test theories as “thought experiments” before breaking out the agar plates and worm food. Usually, biological models concern some small aspect of the organism being studied—the handful of neurons, say, driving forward locomotion. When it comes to modeling, “we don’t want the map to be as good as the territory. That would defeat the purpose,” explained Eduardo Izquierdo, a computational neuroscientist at the Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology who focuses on worm modeling. “We’re looking for something to help us think through things.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eNobody would confuse a biological model with the real thing. But a full-on simulation opens a very different can of worms. To borrow Izquierdo’s reference, it  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eis\u003c/em\u003e  a map as good as the territory—and as such, it invites new speculation about the nature of that territory, to say nothing of life itself. If a model helps scientists answer questions, a simulation raises them. Like, what separates a virtual worm from its living kin, if the two are identical down to the molecule?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe way Larson sees it, a fully faithful worm simulation will be a category-expanding event: Rather than invalidating our current understanding of life, it might broaden it. “If we want to say that aliveness can only be satisfied by systems of physical molecules that physically exist with mass in the planet, something in a computer that doesn’t have physical molecules cannot be alive,” he said. “But if we expand our definition of aliveness to instead be more about information, then perhaps there is a version of aliveness that you could apply to a simulated animal. And then the question is, does it matter?”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eI think it\u003c/span\u003e  matters. Life is information, but it’s something more, too—something we feel most strongly when it’s gone. I wonder if, in this light, Feynman’s dictum shouldn’t be amended. It’s not that creation breeds understanding, exactly. It’s that only by attempting to re-create life can we come to understand how irreplaceable it is.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOf course, I say this because I’m surrounded by destruction. The air is toxic now, and flakes of white ash have eddied into every crevice of the house. At the edge of the evacuation zone, close enough to smell the smoke, I’m keeping myself distracted by cooking up more and more  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eC. elegans\u003c/em\u003e  proto-simulations. Watching them, I can’t help but marvel at how easy it is to destroy life, and how difficult it is to create it. All it takes is a single spark to torch centuries of growth overnight—but to prompt one sluggish inch forward from a virtual worm?

Because light travels at a finite speed of 300 million meters per second, and because space is expanding, observing light from very distant objects is equivalent to seeing what they were like long ago. For example, when we say that MoM z14 is roughly 13.5 billion years old, that means you would have to travel 13.5 billion years at the speed of light to reach it. So far, there is no point detected by a scientific instrument farther away, and at the same time, older, than this one.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe James Webb Space Telescope, with its ability to peer deep into distant space, allows us to study some aspects of the universe in its early stages. How does it do this? By infrared sensors. Due to the expansion of the universe, almost all the galaxies we see from Earth are moving away from us. So, from our point of view, their light appears to have a longer wavelength because it is stretched by this movement. We call this “ \u003ca href='https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/What_is_red_shift' class='link'\u003eredshift\u003c/a\u003e ”: Their wavelengths are redder because they are longer, and so shift towards the red end of the light spectrum.

Christmas Day—particularly the evening—was the best game time of the year. It’s always been a bit of a holiday within the holiday for serious players. The tradition revolves around a phenomenon called “Christmas Noobs.” At Christmas, so many new players receive new games and consoles that online games are flooded with a tidal wave of gamers who often fumble their way through the top games and act like cannon fodder for the waiting legions of seasoned veterans. Mustafa and his mates were skilled at  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eCall of Duty: Advanced Warfare\u003c/em\u003e . “We were all ready for a night of easy wins, quick XP [experience points] farming, and were looking forward to leveling up like crazy.” So, they waited like crocodiles anticipating herds of migrating buffalo to enter the river. But just as the bullets started flying they were all unceremoniously chucked out of their matches and knocked offline. “None of us could log back in, and party chat was down too, so we couldn’t even talk to each other to figure out what was happening,” Mustafa said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt was all over social media: A group of hackers called Lizard Squad were bragging about their massive DDoS attack on Xbox Live and PlayStation Network—the crucial services that linked tens of millions of gamers to the Microsoft and Sony servers. Mustafa had seen that the group had already carried out smaller-scale attacks and had for weeks been taunting and threatening a big attack. Apparently it was all linked to some silly and incomprehensible spat with a rival but minor hacking group. Mustafa was angry but also fascinated by the attack and the incredible reaction online. “The fallout was instantaneous. People were furious,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePlayStation Network at the time had about 110 million subscribers, and Xbox Live had roughly 48 million. Xbox was back to normal within 24 hours—on Boxing Day. But PlayStation struggled for longer. It didn’t just affect existing subscribers. Before you can use any new games, consoles, or vouchers, you need to register them via the gaming company’s servers. It was a catastrophe for the games industry, especially Sony, which had already been having a tough time after a different cyberattack the previous month.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eServices were down around the world.

They showed zero remorse for the impact they’d had on people around the world. Twelve hours later I walked into the newsroom and was given the seemingly impossible task of “getting a Lizard” on the evening TV bulletin at Sky News.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt took hours of trawling Twitter and speaking to dozens of wannabes and fakes, but I eventually succeeded in finding contact details for a British man called Vinnie Omari. Incredibly, he lived a few miles from our newsroom in west London. He agreed to come to us for the interview and was pale, skinny, wore all black and talked fast. He was at pains to distance himself from the gang but left the studios promising that a Lizard Squad hacker called “Ryan” would be in touch. I had no idea at the time of course that this “Ryan” was Julius Kivimäki—an already infamous teenage hacker and delinquent from Finland. It was later that afternoon—at around 3 pm —that “Ryan” called through on Skype. Just in time for us to edit our conversation with him into our news piece.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe 17-year-old looked very young and pale and had a shaved head and soft features. In spite of everything, he was polite and seemed in no rush. But he was also utterly unremorseful and arrogant, struggling to stifle a smirk throughout the interview. When I started by asking him why he wanted to ruin Christmas for tens of millions of people, he gave me the same boilerplate answer about the boys doing it to amuse themselves and embarrass these tech mega corps. “These companies make tens of millions every month from just their subscriber fees, and they should have more than enough funding to be able to protect against these attacks.” We went back and forth for about 15 minutes without him giving any hint of regret or awareness for how many people had been affected by his stunt.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“I’d be worried if those people didn’t have anything better to do than play games on their consoles at Christmas Eve and Christmas Day,” he said. “I mean, I can’t really say I feel bad. I might have forced a couple of kids to spend their time with their families instead of playing games.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe interview blew up online, with more than a million views on YouTube and thousands of comments on Twitter, where many four-letter words were hurled at the Lizards. PlayStation and Xbox also received a torrent of abuse. Later they would offer a five-day extension to players’ subscription periods and 10 percent off as compensation. The resulting bill for the company must easily have been in the millions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eKivimäki went on to speak to other reporters, sometimes calling himself Ryan Cleary (a reference to another hacker he had vague and likely acrimonious link to from a previous teen hacker gang called LulzSec). In one interview and debate on YouTube channel DramaAlert he is implored by Kim Dotcom to stop the silly hacker rivalries that were impacting so many innocent people. “Hackers used to be respected; they used to have a magic about them,” Kim said, accusing Lizard Squad of harming the image of hackers around the world with their actions. Kivimäki’s response is fascinating: He laughed it off as old-fashioned thinking. “It’s wrong to connect groups like Lizard Squad with, for example, L0pht from a couple of decades back,” he said. “There’s really no connection with the hacking groups of today and the hacking groups of two decades ago. The meaning is totally different now.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlthough many security experts angrily railed against the media’s portrayal of Lizard Squad as “sophisticated,” people grudgingly came to accept that the Christmas attack did have a big impact on cybersecurity and the gaming industry. There’s little doubt that this was not the group’s motive—despite their clumsy attempts to claim so in interviews. But it was a wake-up call. Security website SecurityAffairs wrote a “lessons learned” piece by dissecting my interview with Kivimäki. Many people considered Lizard Squad script kiddies, they wrote, adding, “This approach is totally wrong.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe size of the attack unleashed on that day would be shrugged off by most modern sites, but DDoS attacks are still commonplace and are getting more powerful. Expensive protection services are now a must-have for any organization that needs to stay online.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe attacks also started something of a cybercrime trend. In 2024 Europol unveiled an international law enforcement operation to take DDoS services down in December: “The festive season has long been a peak period for hackers to carry out some of their most disruptive DDoS attacks, causing severe financial loss, reputational damage, and operational chaos for their victims,” the organization  \u003ca href='https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/law-enforcement-shuts-down-27-ddos-booters-ahead-of-annual-christmas-attacks' class='link'\u003esaid in a statement\u003c/a\u003e .\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAt the time\u003c/span\u003e  of Lizard Squad’s attacks, the general public was stunned. Despite Lizard Squad being on the tail end of a wave of teenage hacking groups in the 2010s, there was little awareness of the power that could be wielded by these otherwise amateur attackers. There might have been a vague feeling in the zeitgeist that “hackers in hoodies in their bedrooms” were increasingly causing problems, but this attack was immediate, unmissable, and easy to understand. It was of course also easy to get angry about. Over the next couple of days I came back to the story with follow-ups about the fallout as other Lizard Squad members spoke to YouTubers about the so-called “drama.” But the big thing the newsroom kept asking me was, When would these kids be arrested?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eVinnie Omari was the first. On New Year’s Eve he was raided by the South East Regional Organized Crime Unit, which collared him on suspicion of cyber fraud offenses committed in 2013 and 2014. It looked like the raid was for other alleged offenses involving PayPal fraud, but the search warrant, which later surfaced online, also referenced the Christmas DDoS attacks. “They took everything: Xbox One, phones, laptops, computer USBs, etc.,” Omari told reporter William Turton from the Daily Dot. He was later cleared of any involvement.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter Omari’s arrest, other Lizards were taken out too. On January 16, 2015, police announced that they had arrested an 18-year-old in Southport, near Liverpool. They didn’t give a name, but reporters at the Daily Mail identified him: “The ‘quiet’ teenager, named locally as Jordan Lee-Bevan, was arrested during a raid at his semi-detached home in Southport, Merseyside, today, with officers seizing computers as he was taken away in a police car.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn 2016 teenager Zachary Buchta from Maryland was also arrested for his role in Lizard Squad and another group called PoodleCorp. As a boy he had been warned in 2014 about his criminal path by police who had caught him carrying out minor cybercrime activity. But he was undeterred and even changed his Twitter profile at one stage to @fbiarelosers to taunt the cops.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt the same time that Buchta was arrested, Dutch police raided and arrested another 19-year-old. Bradley van Rooy, who used the names “Uchiha” or “UchihaLS,” was accused of conspiring with other members of Lizard Squad to operate websites that provided cyberattack-for-hire services, facilitating thousands of DDoS attacks and trafficking stolen payment card account information for thousands of victims.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBradley was put on bail for two years and eventually given a two-year suspended sentence and 180 hours of community service. The vast majority of charges against him were dropped as they had taken place when he was a minor. He ended up being convicted of the DDoS-for-hire operation and handling stolen credit cards. I tracked him down, and he openly talked about that period of his life, which he had put behind him a long time ago. “I’m now 27, and I see the damage that I did and understand that there could have been a higher punishment,” he says. “But then I also see that I was just a kid, and I had a troubled time at school and just fell into the hacking life after meeting the wrong people when I was playing the game  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eRuneScape\u003c/em\u003e .”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBradley’s journey and words track so perfectly to the experiences of almost every hacker I have met or interviewed. It’s as though there is a universal constant, whereby a subset of gamers in every generation is pulled into cybercrime in exactly the same way. There are literally billions of gamers in the world, so these people represent only a tiny fraction. But it seems to be inevitable and cyclical as hacker groups rise and fall.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe differentiating and more important aspect, though, is how these boys and young men react when they cross the line and are caught.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo what of Julius Kivimäki, aka “Ryan,” aka “Ryan Cleary” and many other aliases including the by now infamous “Zeekill”?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSurely, after appearing on TV and radio admitting that he was part of the gang, he too would be rearrested sharpish? Officers did indeed visit Kivimäki to interview him, but they did not arrest him—contrary to reports in the international media. It’s not clear why they took no further action, but perhaps when the teenager confidently said that police would find nothing on his computer he was right. “They’d have to let me go,” he had cockily asserted in our interview. If so, maybe his run-in with police years earlier had taught him to cover his tracks more effectively. Or maybe he hadn’t taken as much of a leading role in the DDoS attacks as he had claimed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor Finnish cybercrime cop Antti Kurittu, seeing Kivimäki on TV was especially galling. Antti had raided and arrested Kivimaki two years earlier for other cyberattacks carried out with a different teenage cyber gang called HTP. “I remember watching your Sky News interview and just thinking ‘wow, this guy is not even trying to cover up his crimes. He’s just a different sort of person,’” Antti recalls.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt wasn’t until July 2015 that Kivimäki received his first criminal conviction. He was found guilty of the rather preposterous total of 50,700 instances of aggravated computer break-ins—one for every computer enslaved into HTPs botnet. He was also convicted of other offenses including data breach, money laundering, and being in possession of, and using, stolen credit cards. For all of these offenses, he was handed a two-year suspended sentence. If he had been an adult he could have got years behind bars, but as a minor and first-time offender he served no time in prison. So Kivimäki, just a few weeks from his 18th birthday, remained free. He began calling himself the “Untouchable Hacker God” on Twitter.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA year after Kivimäki’s sentencing, in a bizarre coincidence, Antti bumped into Kivimäki in Amsterdam. It was April 2016 and Antti was walking through the departures lounge of Schiphol Airport when he passed the by-then 18-year-old. Antti did a double take, gobsmacked to see him.

They might just as easily attack the computerized and automated elements of an enemy’s critical infrastructure, with potentially disastrous consequences for civilians: In a world increasingly reliant on computers, that could mean debilitating sabotage against railways, stock exchanges, airlines, and even the electric grid that underpins so many of those vital systems.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHacking didn’t need to be confined to some tactic on the periphery of war: Cyberattacks could themselves be a weapon of war. It was perhaps that definition of cyberwar that President Bill Clinton had in mind in 2001 when he  \u003ca href='https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/PPP-2000-book1/html/PPP-2000-book1-doc-pg13-2.htm' class='link'\u003ewarned in a speech\u003c/a\u003e  that “today, our critical systems, from power structures to air traffic control, are connected and run by computers” and that someone can sit at the same computer, hack into a computer system, and potentially paralyze a company, a city, or a government.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eSince then, that definition for cyberwar has been honed into one that was perhaps most clearly laid out in the 2010 book  \u003ca href='https://www.harpercollins.com/9780061962233/cyber-war/' class='link'\u003e\u003cem class='italic'\u003eCyber War\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e , cowritten by Richard Clarke, a national security advisor to Presidents Bush, Clinton, and Bush, and Robert Knake, who would later serve as a cybersecurity advisor to President Obama. Clarke and Knake defined cyberwar as “actions by a nation-state to penetrate another nation’s computers or networks for the purpose of causing damage or disruption.” Put more simply, that definition roughly encompasses the same things we’ve always identified as “acts of war,” only now carried out by digital means. But as the world was learning by the time Clarke and Knake wrote that definition, digital attacks have the potential to reach out beyond mere computers to have real, physical consequences.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eProto-Cyberwars\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe first major historical event that could credibly fit Clarke and Knake’s definition—what some have dubbed “ \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/2007/08/ff-estonia/' class='link'\u003eWeb War I\u003c/a\u003e ”—had arrived just a few years earlier. It hit one of the world’s most wired countries: Estonia.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the the spring of 2007, an unprecedented series of so-called distributed denial of service, or DDoS, attacks slammed more than a hundred Estonian websites, taking down the country’s online banking, digital news media, government sites, and practically anything else that had a web presence. The attacks were a response to the Estonian government’s decision to move a Soviet-era statue out of a central location in the capital city of Tallinn, angering the country’s Russian-speaking minority and triggering protests on the city’s streets and the web.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003caside class='Sidebar-pgAgH kmwJca'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eWhat cyberwar is not\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eCyberespionage\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCyberwar is not simply stealing information, neither the global great game of nations spying on each other’s governments nor the more controversial sort of private-sector economic espionage that the US has long accused China of carrying out.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eCybercrime\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCyberwar is not profit-focused hacking like bank fraud or the ransomware attacks that seek to extort millions from victims—that’s cybercrime, no matter how cruel and costly its effects may sometimes be.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eInformation Warfare\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCyberwar is not—although this point may be the most debated—the \u0026#34;influence operations\u0026#34; that seek to spread disinformation and propaganda, or to hurt an adversary by leaking damaging information about them.

Some of the attacks’ sources even overlapped with earlier DDoS attacks that had a clear political focus, including attacks that hit the website of Gary Kasparov, the Russian chess champion and opposition political leader. Today security analysts widely believe that the attacks were condoned by the Kremlin, if not actively coordinated by its leaders.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBy the next year, that Russian government link to politically motivated cyberattacks was becoming more apparent. Another, very similar series of DDoS attacks struck dozens of websites in another Russian neighbor, Georgia. This time they accompanied an actual physical invasion—a Russian intervention to “protect” Russia-friendly separatists within Georgia’s borders—complete with tanks rolling toward the Georgian capital and a Russian fleet blockading the country’s coastline on the Black Sea. In some cases, digital attacks would hit web targets associated with specific towns just ahead of military forces’ arrival, another suggestion of coordination.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe 2008 Georgian war was perhaps the first real hybrid war in which conventional military and hacker forces were combined. But given Georgia’s low rate of internet adoption—about  \u003ca href='https://ccdcoe.org/library/publications/international-cyber-incidents-legal-considerations/' class='link'\u003e7 percent of Georgians used the internet at the time\u003c/a\u003e —and Russia’s relatively simplistic cyberattacks, which merely tore down and defaced websites, it stands as more of a historic harbinger of cyberwar than the real thing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eFirst Shots\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe world’s conception of cyberwar changed forever in 2010. It started when VirusBlokAda, a security firm in Belarus, found a mysterious piece of malware that crashed the computers running its antivirus software. By September of that year, the security research community had come to the shocking conclusion that the specimen of malware, dubbed Stuxnet, was in fact the most sophisticated piece of code ever engineered for a cyberattack, and that it was specifically designed to destroy the centrifuges used in Iran’s nuclear enrichment facilities. (That detective work is best captured in Kim Zetter’s definitive book  \u003ca href='https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/219931/countdown-to-zero-day-by-kim-zetter/9780770436193/' class='link'\u003e\u003cem class='italic'\u003eCountdown to Zero Day\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e .)

After spreading through the Iranians\u0026#39; network, it had injected commands into the so-called programmable logic controllers, or PLCs, that governed the centrifuges, speeding them up or manipulating the pressure inside them until they tore themselves apart. Stuxnet would come to be recognized as the first cyberattack ever designed to directly damage physical equipment, and an act of cyberwar that has yet to be replicated in its virtuosic destructive effects. It would also serve as the starting pistol shot for the global cyber arms race that followed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eIran soon entered that arms race, this time as aggressor rather than target. In August of 2012, the Saudi Arabian firm Saudi Aramco, one of the world’s largest oil producers, was  \u003ca href='https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/24/business/global/cyberattack-on-saudi-oil-firm-disquiets-us.html' class='link'\u003ehit with a piece of malware known as Shamoon that wiped 35,000 of the company’s computers\u003c/a\u003e —about three-quarters of them—leaving its operations essentially paralyzed. On the screens of the crippled machines, the malware left an image of a burning American flag. A group calling itself “Cutting Sword of Justice” claimed credit for the attack as an activist statement, but cybersecurity analysts quickly suspected that Iran was ultimately responsible, and had used the Saudis as a proxy target in retaliation for Stuxnet.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe next month, Iranian hackers  \u003ca href='https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/09/technology/online-banking-attacks-were-work-of-iran-us-officials-say.html' class='link'\u003ecalling themselves Operation Ababil hit every major US bank\u003c/a\u003e , knocking their websites offline with sustained volleys of DDoS attacks, a far more focused version of the takedown technique Russians had used against sites in Estonia and Georgia. Again, cybersecurity analysts detected the hand of Iran’s government in the attack’s sophistication despite the “hacktivist” front, perhaps a more direct message from Iran’s state-sponsored hackers that any future US cyberattacks wouldn’t go unanswered. A little over a year later, in February 2014, Iranian hackers launched another, more targeted attack on American soil: Following public comments from Zionist billionaire Sheldon Adelson suggesting the US use a nuclear weapon on Iran,  \u003ca href='https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-12-11/iranian-hackers-hit-sheldon-adelsons-sands-casino-in-las-vegas' class='link'\u003esophisticated hackers hit Adelson’s Las Vegas Sands casino\u003c/a\u003e , using destructive malware to wipe thousands of computers, just as in the Saudi Aramco case.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eBy 2014, Iran was no longer the only rogue nation exploiting the potential for cyberattacks to reach across the globe and inflict pain against civilian targets. North Korea, too, was flexing its cyberwar muscles. After years of staging punishing DDoS attacks on its favorite adversary, South Korea, North Korean hackers launched a more daring operation: In December 2014,  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/2014/12/sony-hack-what-we-know/' class='link'\u003ehackers revealed they had deeply penetrated the network of Sony Pictures\u003c/a\u003e  ahead of its release of  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eThe Interview\u003c/em\u003e , a low-brow comedy movie about an assassination plot against North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un. The hackers, calling themselves the Guardians of Peace, stole and leaked reams of emails along with several unreleased films. They capped off their raid by wiping thousands of computers. (Though the leaks might be called a mere influence operation, the disruptive data deletion pushes the incident across the cyberwar line.) The hackers left a menacing image on wiped computers of a skeleton, along with an extortion message; they demanded both money and that the release of  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eThe Interview\u003c/em\u003e  be canceled. Despite that cybercriminal ruse, the FBI publicly named the North Korean government as the perpetrator of the attack, based in part on a slip-up that  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/2015/01/fbi-director-says-north-korean-hackers-sometimes-failed-use-proxies-sony-hack/' class='link'\u003erevealed a Chinese IP address known to be used by North Korean hackers\u003c/a\u003e .

They targeted Ukrainian media and infrastructure, including its national railway and Kyiv\u0026#39;s airport, destroying hundreds of computers across those victims\u0026#39; networks. Then, the day before Christmas, the same hackers carried out a far more shocking and unprecedented act of sabotage: They attacked three Ukrainian regional energy utilities,  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/2016/03/inside-cunning-unprecedented-hack-ukraines-power-grid/' class='link'\u003eturning out the lights to about 225,000 civilians\u003c/a\u003e , the first known blackout in history ever to be caused by a cyberattack.

Those riots were accompanied by a wave of crude distributed denial-of-service attacks that took down hundreds of Estonian websites, likely launched with the backing of the Russian government.\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003chr class='my-4 border-t border-gray-300'\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen, a week before Christmas, the hackers triggered another blackout, this time in the capital city of Kyiv. The attack only knocked out a fraction of the city’s power for a single hour, but did so by hitting a transmission station rather than distribution substations as the hackers had a year before, a form of targeting that could have caused a far more widespread blackout. That second blackout attack also used a new, foreboding tool, something security researchers have  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/crash-override-malware/' class='link'\u003enamed Industroyer or Crash Override\u003c/a\u003e . This custom-made malware was designed to send rapid-fire commands directly to circuit breakers in a victim utility, automating the power-killing process and scaling it up so that it could, in the future, be used simultaneously against multiple facilities.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat Russian malware was the first specimen of code found in the wild since Stuxnet that directly targeted physical equipment. The tool featured a modular structure that would allow it to be easily adapted to other grid targets in Western Europe or the US, all signs that Russia’s hackers were seeking not only to inflict more disruption and terror against Ukrainians were but also experimenting with and demonstrating sabotage techniques they might easily use elsewhere.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn fact, all of those attacks were just a prelude to the main event of the cyberwar being waged against Ukraine. In late June of 2017, Russian hackers used the hacked servers of the Ukrainian accounting firm Linkos Group to push out a piece of code that would  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/notpetya-cyberattack-ukraine-russia-code-crashed-the-world/' class='link'\u003ecome to be called NotPetya\u003c/a\u003e . Combining the leaked NSA hacking program EternalBlue and the password-stealing tool Mimikatz into an automated worm, it spread almost instantly to an estimated 10 percent of all the computers in Ukraine, encrypting their contents with a destructive payload disguised to look like ransomware, but with no mechanism for actually decrypting files after the victim paid a ransom. (It appeared, at first, to be a version of the older Petya ransomware used by cybercriminals, but was not—hence its name.) Across Ukraine, it shut down banks, ATMs, and point-of-sale systems, paralyzing nearly all the country’s government agencies and crippling infrastructure like airports and railways, along with hospitals, the national post office, and even the operation monitoring radioactivity levels at the ruins of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut NotPetya’s virulence wasn’t contained by national borders. It also hit A.P. Møller-Maersk, the world’s largest shipping firm; US pharmaceutical company Merck; FedEx’s European subsidiary TNT Express; French construction company Saint-Gobain; food producer Mondelez; and manufacturer Reckitt Benckiser. In each of those cases, it saturated networks, killing thousands of computers and inflicting hundreds of millions of dollars in lost business and cleanup costs. It struck at least two US hospitals and shut down the speech-to-text software firm Nuance, which provided medical record transcription services to more than a hundred more hospitals and clinics. NotPetya even spread back to Russia, inflicting further collateral damage on victims like the state oil company Rosneft, steelmaker Evraz, medical technology firm Invitro, and Sberbank. In all, a White House estimate would later put the cost of NotPetya at $10 billion at least, though the full extent of its damage may never be known.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class='AssetEmbedWrapper-eVDQiB byBkf asset-embed'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cpicture class='ResponsiveImagePicture-cWuUZO dUOtEa AssetEmbedResponsiveAsset-cXBNxi lqMXz asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image'\u003e\u003cimg src='https://media.wired.com/photos/5a726e8cd107c842c752925b/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/whatsnext.jpg' alt='What Is Cyberwar The Complete WIRED Guide'\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eThe Future of Cyberwar\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd yet, it could still get worse. Few cybersecurity analysts will take the bet that NotPetya will remain a one-off catastrophe. Just a month before that worm, after all,  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/2017/05/wannacry-ransomware-link-suspected-north-korean-hackers/' class='link'\u003eNorth Korean hackers had launched their own ransomware worm known as WannaCry\u003c/a\u003e  that was nearly as destructive. It shut down networks as far flung as Chinese universities, Indian police departments, and even the British National Health Service, causing thousands of medical appointments to be canceled across the UK and ultimately costing between  \u003ca href='https://www.cbsnews.com/news/wannacry-ransomware-attacks-wannacry-virus-losses/' class='link'\u003e$4 and\u003c/a\u003e   \u003ca href='https://www.reinsurancene.ws/reinsurance-take-minimal-share-8-billion-wannacry-economic-loss-m-best/' class='link'\u003e$8 billion\u003c/a\u003e . (While WannaCry shows the potential for other nation-states to launch such megaworms, it doesn’t necessarily count as a clear act of cyberwar itself, given that WannaCry did actually seem intended to collect ransoms from victims. The North Korean government, uniquely among global cyberpowers, focuses on cybercriminal profit as much as politically motivated attacks.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere are hints of how a future cyberattack might cause even more disruption, or even physical destruction. In August 2017,  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/triton-malware-targets-industrial-safety-systems-in-the-middle-east/' class='link'\u003ea piece of malware called Triton or Trisis triggered the shutdown of an oil refinery\u003c/a\u003e  owned by the  \u003ca href='https://www.eenews.net/stories/1060123327' class='link'\u003eSaudi Arabian firm Petro Rabigh\u003c/a\u003e . After months of reverse-engineering, security researchers determined that the malicious code wasn’t actually intended to cause a shutdown, but instead was aimed at silently disabling the so-called safety-instrumented systems of the plant—the equipment that serves as a last-ditch technological safeguard to prevent unsafe conditions, like a buildup of temperature or pressure. Stealthily borking those systems could have led to potentially lethal accidents like an explosion or gas leak.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s still far from clear who the hackers responsible for that ultra-dangerous malware are, or what country they might be working for. While Iran quickly became the prime target of security industry speculation—given its tension and proxy wars with Saudi Arabia—in late 2018 security firm FireEye  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/triton-malware-russia-industrial-controls/' class='link'\u003euncovered fingerprints that linked back to Moscow’s Central Scientific Research Institute of Chemistry and Mechanics\u003c/a\u003e . That could mean that Russia was responsible for the attack, or merely that Russian malware developers were working on behalf of Iranian or another country’s hackers. (Iran, meanwhile, has over the past three years continued to  \u003ca href='https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-shamoon-2-delivering-disttrack/' class='link'\u003eperiodically launch new waves of data destruction\u003c/a\u003e  against targets in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates with revamped versions of the Shamoon wiper malware it used against Saudi Aramco.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAside from the prospect of attacks on safety systems and the looming possibility of another NotPetya-style worm, plenty of other nightmare hypotheticals continue to trouble the sleep of cyberwar wonks. They fear cyberattacks on water distribution systems, financial systems, gas pipelines, hospitals—perhaps even combined with a mass-casualty physical attack. And after the blackout attacks in Ukraine, they warn that far more severe attacks on the electric grid are possible. Way back in 2007, for instance, US researchers at Idaho National Laboratory showed in a demonstration that it was possible to  \u003ca href='https://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2016/nov/14/aurora-generator-test-homeland-security/' class='link'\u003edestroy a tank-sized diesel generator with malicious code alone\u003c/a\u003e . (See the video of their demonstration below.) That notion—of a cyberattack that doesn’t merely disable grid equipment but physically destroys its components—still haunts grid-focused cybersecurity analysts. They warn that such a tactic, particularly if it were used on multiple targets simultaneously, could cause blackouts extending far beyond the mere hours of Ukraine’s hacker blackouts, stretching for days or weeks.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class='IframeEmbedWrapper-sc-dRedg kSrFfN iframe-embed'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003ciframe src='' width='' height='300px' class='border-0 mt-4' allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile the US has largely been spared from targeted cyberwar attacks—the collateral devastation of NotPetya aside—US intelligence warns that countries like China and Russia have already infiltrated American infrastructure to “prepare the battlefield” for any future cyberconflict. “China has the ability to launch cyber attacks that cause localized, temporary disruptive effects on critical infrastructure—such as disruption of a natural gas pipeline for days to weeks—in the United States,” noted a  \u003ca href='https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/2019-ATA-SFR---SSCI.pdf' class='link'\u003ereport from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence\u003c/a\u003e  earlier this year. “Moscow is mapping our critical infrastructure with the long-term goal of being able to cause substantial damage.” Unspoken in such reports is the near certainty that America\u0026#39;s own hackers are laying the same logic bombs inside foreign networks, too.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eCyberpeace?\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eGiven that seemingly inexorable ramp-up of cyberwar\u0026#39;s destructive potential, how do humans head off a chaotic future of endless, widespread digital conflict? The most obvious answer is, of course, better cybersecurity: The owners of critical infrastructure across the government and private sector could certainly invest more in hardening their networks, separating vital systems from the internet wherever possible. But in cyberwar, as in the larger game of cybersecurity, the offense has the advantage: Don\u0026#39;t expect any security technology to prevent all future cyberattacks. Perhaps most importantly, critical infrastructure operators, government agencies, and companies need to focus on building  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eresilient\u003c/em\u003e  systems—ones whose backups and redundancies mean that they can bounce back quickly from serious cyberattacks.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut cyberwar wonks also say that old-fashioned  \u003cem class='italic'\u003edeterrence\u003c/em\u003e  needs to play a role, too. Countries need to face serious repercussions when they launch a cyberattack that violates some sort of red lines defining global norms of acceptable and unacceptable hacking activities. The Obama and Trump White Houses have taken the first steps to that kind of deterrence regime: The Obama administration indicted seven Iranian hackers for their roles in attacking US banks. Obama himself called out North Korea for its Sony cyberattack in a speech, and  \u003ca href='https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/06/north-korean-hackers-will-be-charged-for-sony-pictures-wannacry-ransomware-attacks.html' class='link'\u003eimposed new sanctions against the country\u003c/a\u003e . The Trump administration, for all its alleged friendliness toward Russian hackers, did eventually  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/russia-sanctions-ira-gru-white-house/' class='link'\u003eimpose new sanctions against the country\u0026#39;s intelligence officials in response to their NotPetya chaos and operations that penetrated the US power grid.\u003c/a\u003e .\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut those actions aren\u0026#39;t enough, in part because the red lines they seek to enforce are still being drawn. For nearly a decade, cyberpolicy doves have been calling, largely in vain, for some sort of global treaty or convention that could establish rules for cyberwarfare. In their 2010 book  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eCyber War\u003c/em\u003e , Clarke and Knake proposed a Cyber War Limitation Treaty, which would ban first-use attacks on another country\u0026#39;s critical infrastructure. More recently, Microsoft president Brad Smith has called for a  \u003ca href='https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/cybersecurity/content-hub/a-digital-geneva-convention-to-protect-cyberspace' class='link'\u003eDigital Geneva Convention\u003c/a\u003e  that would prohibit cyberattacks on civilian targets. Josh Corman, a former director of the Cyber Statecraft Initiative at the Atlantic Council think tank, has suggested a more limited agreement that he describes as a \u0026#34;cyber no-fly-zone\u0026#34; around hospitals, one that would essentially start the process of limiting cyberwarfare by making any life-threatening attack on medical facilities a war crime.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut as the cyberwar arms race escalates, none of those cyberpeace initiatives has gained much traction. Critics point out that cyberattack motives are hard to define—a cyberespionage or reconnaissance intrusion can often look a lot like a cyberwar attack in progress—and determining the identities of the hackers responsible can be even harder. (That so-called attribution problem hasn\u0026#39;t stopped the US government from definitively naming the governments responsible for most serious attacks that affected Western targets over the last decade. US intelligence agencies can use both human sources and their own powerful hacking capabilities to find the culprits behind cyberattacks even when the public can\u0026#39;t.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMore fundamentally, governments haven\u0026#39;t been willing to sign on to cyberwar limitation agreements because they don\u0026#39;t want to limit their own freedom to launch cyberattacks at their enemies. America may be vulnerable to crippling cyberattacks carried out by its foes, but US leaders are still hesitant to hamstring America’s own NSA and Cyber Command, who are likely the most talented and well-resourced hackers in the world. The Trump administration has only loosened the leash on Cyber Command, elevating its authority and freeing it up to launch preemptive attacks on enemy infrastructure.

Wait, what’s the difference? Of all the things to ask Redmond when I run into her at a happy hour later that day, that’s what I choose.

We’re sitting in an engineering lab at UC Berkeley, and Patterson—77 years old, partial to no-frills athleisure—is scribbling on a whiteboard. A computer’s base operation, he explains, is the simplest of all: ADD. From there you can derive SUBTRACT. With LOAD and STORE, plus 30 or so other core functions, you have a complete basis for digital computation. Computer architects call this the “instruction set architecture,” or the ISA. (They switch between saying each letter, “I-S-A,” and—the neater option—pronouncing it as a word, “eye-suh.”)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eComputer architectures are so named because, well, that’s exactly what they are—architectures not of bricks but of bits. The people who made  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eHackers\u003c/em\u003e  plainly understood this. In sequences of  \u003ca href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IESEcsjDcmM' class='link'\u003edorky-awesome special effects\u003c/a\u003e , we fly through futuristic streets, look up at futuristic buildings, only to realize: This isn’t a city. This is a microchip.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eEven within a chip, there are subarchitectures. First come the silicon atoms themselves, and on top of those go the transistors, the circuits and gates, the microprocessors, and so on. You’ll find the ISA at the highest layer of the hardware. It is, I think, the most profound architecture ever devised by humans, at any scale. It runs the CPU, the computer’s brain. It’s the precise point, in other words, at which dead, inert, hard silicon becomes, via a set of powerful animating conjurations, soft and malleable—alive.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEveryone has their own way of explaining it. The ISA is the  \u003cem class='italic'\u003ebridge\u003c/em\u003e , or the  \u003cem class='italic'\u003einterface\u003c/em\u003e , between the hardware and the software. Or it’s the  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eblueprint\u003c/em\u003e . Or it’s the computer’s  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eDNA\u003c/em\u003e . These are helpful enough, as is the common comparison of an ISA to a  \u003cem class='italic'\u003elanguage\u003c/em\u003e . “You and I are using English,” as Redmond said to me at the conference. “That’s our ISA.” But it gets confusing. Software speaks in languages too—programming languages. That’s why Patterson prefers  \u003cem class='italic'\u003edictionary\u003c/em\u003e  or  \u003cem class='italic'\u003evocabulary\u003c/em\u003e . The ISA is less a specific language, more a set of generally available words.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBack when Patterson started out, in the 1970s, the early ISAs were spinning out of control. Established tech companies figured that as hardware design improved and programming languages got more sophisticated, computers shouldn’t remain simple; they should be taught  \u003cem class='italic'\u003elarger\u003c/em\u003e  vocabularies, with  \u003cem class='italic'\u003elonger\u003c/em\u003e  words. The more types of operations they were capable of, the logic went, the more efficient their calculations would be.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn the whiteboard, Patterson scrawls the word POLYNOMIAL in big letters—just one of the hundreds of operations that Intel and others added to their ISAs. Even as a young recruit at Berkeley, Patterson suspected that the bigwigs had it backward, that exactly none of these esoteric add-ons were necessary. That a bigger dictionary did not lead to clearer sentences.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo he and a senior colleague decided to strip the kruft from the instruction sets of midcentury computing. At the time, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency was giving out grants for “high-risk” research. Patterson says they chose the acronym RISC— \u003cem class='italic'\u003ereduced\u003c/em\u003e  instruction set computer—as a fundraising ploy. Darpa gave them the money.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePatterson then did as aspiring academics do: He wrote a spicy paper. Called “The Case for the Reduced Instruction Set Computer” and published in 1980, it set off a great war of architectures. “The question then,” as Patterson would later say in an acceptance speech for a major prize, “was whether RISC or CISC was faster.” CISC (pronounced “sisk”) was the name Patterson gave the rival camp:  \u003cem class='italic'\u003ecomplex\u003c/em\u003e  instruction set computer. The CISCites fired back with a paper of their own and, at international conferences throughout the early ’80s, battled it out with the RISCites onstage, the bloodshed often spilling into the hallways and late-night afterparties. Patterson taunted his opponents: They were driving lumbering trucks while he was in a feather-light roadster. If you magnify a RISC-based microchip from those years, you’ll spot a sports car etched into the upper left corner, just 0.4 millimeters in length.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe RISCites won. With vigilant testing, they proved that their machines were between three and four times faster than the CISC equivalents. The RISC chips had to perform more operations per second, it’s true—but would you rather read a paragraph of simple words, or a sentence of polysyllabic verbiage? In the end, CISCites retracted their claims to supremacy, and the likes of Intel turned to RISC for their architectural needs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class='AssetEmbedWrapper-eVDQiB byBkf asset-embed'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cpicture class='ResponsiveImagePicture-cWuUZO dUOtEa AssetEmbedResponsiveAsset-cXBNxi lqMXz asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image'\u003e\u003cimg src='https://media.wired.com/photos/67d03d4838d5984f21140ed0/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/WEB-004_JennaGarrett_WIRED_RISC.jpg' alt='Image may contain David A.

When  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eHackers\u003c/em\u003e  came out in 1995, Patterson was flabbergasted to hear his life’s work, 15 years old by that point, mentioned so casually and seductively by a Hollywood starlet. Computers were still too geeky, surely, to matter to the masses. (When I make Patterson rewatch the scene, he’s all smiles and pride, though he does say they mistake “refresh rate” for “clock rate.”)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStill, Patterson’s invention was indeed changing everything. In those years, a rising company in the UK called Arm—the “r” in its name stood for RISC—was working with Steve Jobs on tablet-sized devices that needed smaller, faster CPUs. That effort stalled, but one thing led to another, and if you’re reading this on a phone right now, you have RISC-based Arm architectures to thank. When Patterson walks me out of the Berkeley building at the end of our dizzying afternoon together, we stop by a handsome bronze plaque in the lobby that commemorates his “milestone” creation of the first RISC microprocessor. We stare at it in prayerful awe. “1980–1982,” it reads—the bloodiest years of the great architecture war.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBetter make room for another plaque, I note.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class='AssetEmbedWrapper-eVDQiB byBkf asset-embed'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cpicture class='ResponsiveImagePicture-cWuUZO dUOtEa AssetEmbedResponsiveAsset-cXBNxi lqMXz asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image'\u003e\u003cimg src='https://media.wired.com/photos/67d1fc5ae3dd1d52d70b1016/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/section%2520break-1.png' alt='Image may contain Gray'\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe year is\u003c/span\u003e  now 2008. Two instruction sets exert near-total control over digital life. One is called x86, the descendent of Intel’s legacy CISC architecture, and it dominates the high end of machinery: personal computers and servers. Arm’s RISC architecture, meanwhile, dominates everything else: phones, game consoles, the internet of things. Different though they are, and with opposite origins, these two ISAs share one important feature: They’re both  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eclosed\u003c/em\u003e , proprietary. You can’t modify them, and if you want to use them, you have to pay for them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAndrew Waterman, a graduate student at—where else?—UC Berkeley, finds this frustrating. As a computer architect, he wants to build things, deep things. Things at the very foundations of computing. But right now he has no good ISAs to play with. Arm and x86 are off-limits, and the free architectures for students are just so … baggy. They use register windows to speed up procedure calls, for God’s sake! Never mind what that means. The point is, every person in this story is a genius.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo Waterman and two other geniuses have an idea: Why not create a new, better-working, free ISA for academic use? It’s an idea they know someone else has had before. To Patterson they go. And because he’s their inspiration, and because he has worked on four generations of RISC architectures by this point, they’ll call it, they announce to him proudly, RISC-V. Patterson is touched. A bit skeptical, sure, especially when they say they’ll be done in three months. But touched. He gives the boys his blessing, his resources, and a classic bit of advice: Keep it simple, stupid.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRISC-V does not take three months. It takes closer to four years. If I’ve failed, so far, to account for the precision of this work, let me try again here. Computer architects are not software engineers, who use programming languages to talk to the machine. Even coders who can speak assembly or C, the so-called low-level languages, still do just that: They talk. Computer architects need to go deeper. Much deeper. All the way down to a preverbal realm. If they’re speaking at all, they’re speaking in gestures, motions: the way primitive circuits hold information. Computer architecture isn’t telling a machine what to do. It’s establishing the possibility that it can be told anything at all. The work is superhuman, if not fully alien. Put it this way: If you found the exact place in a human being where matter becomes mind, where body becomes soul—a place that no scientist or philosopher or spiritual figure has found in 5,000 years of frantic searching—wouldn’t you tread carefully? One wrong move and everything goes silent.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn 2011, Waterman and his two collaborators, Krste Asanović and Yunsup Lee, release RISC-V into the wild. They’ve accomplished their mission: Geeky grad students everywhere, and hobbyists too, have an ISA for whatever computer-architecting adventures they might undertake. These early days feel utopian.

To review: Patterson invented RISC in 1980 and went to battle with the established ISAs. He won. Thirty years later, his disciples reinvent RISC for a new age, and he and they go to battle with the very company whose success secured RISC’s legacy in the first place: Arm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn response to Patterson’s paper, Arm fires back with a rebuttal, “The Case for Licensed Instruction Sets.” Nobody wants some random, untested, unsupported ISA, they say. Customers want success, standards, a proven “ecosystem.” The resources it would take to retool and reprogram everything for a new ISA? There’s not enough cash in the world, Arm scoffs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe RISC-V community disagrees. They create their own ecosystem under the auspices of RISC-V International and begin adapting RISC-V to the needs of modern computing. Some supporters start calling it an “open source hardware” movement, even if hardcore RISC-Vers don’t love the phrase. Hardware, being set in literal stone, can’t exactly be “open source,” and besides, RISC-V doesn’t count, entirely, as hardware. It’s the hardware-software  \u003cem class='italic'\u003einterface\u003c/em\u003e , remember. But, semantics. The point stands: Anyone, in any bedroom or garage or office in any part of the world, can use RISC-V for free to build their own computers from scratch, to chart their own technological destiny.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eArm is right about one thing, though: This does take money. Millions if not billions of dollars. (If you think “fabless” chip printers can do it for closer to five figures, come back to me in five years.) Still, RISC-V begins to win. Much as Arm, in the 1990s and 2000s, found success in low-end markets, so too, in the 2010s, does RISC-V: special-purpose gadgets, computer chips in automobiles, that sort of thing. Why pay for Intel chips or Arm licenses when you don’t have to?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd the guys at Berkeley? In 2015, they launch their own company, called  \u003ca href='https://www.sifive.com/' class='link'\u003eSiFive\u003c/a\u003e , to build computer parts based on RISC-V.

I could still feel it everywhere.  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eWe’ve won\u003c/em\u003e , I heard several times.  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eNobody’s happy at Arm\u003c/em\u003e , someone claimed. (One longtime higher-up at Arm, who insisted on anonymity to discuss internal affairs, disputed “nobody” but admitted there’s been a “culture change” in recent years.) On the second day of the conference, when news broke of a rift between Arm and one of its biggest customers, Qualcomm, people cheered in the hallways. “Arm is assholes,” a former SiFive exec told me. In fact, only one person at the conference seemed to have anything nice to say about the competition. He was working a demo booth, and when I marveled that his product was built on a RISC-V processor, he turned a little green and whispered: “Actually, it’s Arm. Don’t tell anyone. Please don’t tell anyone.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBooth bro was probably worrying too much. In the hardware world, everyone has worked, or has friends, everywhere else. Calista Redmond, the star of the show, spent 12 years at IBM (and recently resigned from RISC-V International for a job at Nvidia). Even Patterson has ties to, of all places, Intel—which, though less of a direct threat than Arm, is still a RISC-V competitor. It was Intel grant money, Patterson happily admits, that paid for the Berkeley architects to invent RISC-V in the first place. Without closed source, proprietary Big Tech, there’s no open source, free-for-all Little Tech. Don’t listen to the techno-hippies who claim otherwise; that’s always been the case.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003ePatterson was the big-ticket speaker on the second day of the conference, and in  \u003ca href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMxJv1UffSM\u0026list=PL85jopFZCnbNTnNxGw9fz1VBCSQfxtEDB\u0026index=50' class='link'\u003ehis talk\u003c/a\u003e , he brought up the paper that Arm wrote in rebuttal to his, lo those 10 years ago. One of its two authors has since parted ways with Arm. The other, Patterson noted, not only left—he now works at SiFive. “It’s satisfying,” Patterson said, “he has come to his senses.” Which got a laugh, of course, but I was still stuck on something Patterson said earlier in the talk, about RISC-V: “We want world domination.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis is not, even remotely, an impossibility. RISC-V has already done what many thought impossible and made a sizable dent in Arm’s and Intel’s architectural dominance. Everyone from Meta and Google and Nvidia to NASA has begun to integrate it into their machinery. Something on the order of  \u003cem class='italic'\u003ebillions\u003c/em\u003e  of RISC-V processing units now ship every year. Most of these, again, support low-powered, specialized devices, but as Redmond pointed out a number of times at the conference, “we have laptops now.” This is the first year you can buy a  \u003ca href='https://frame.work/products/deep-computing-risc-v-mainboard' class='link'\u003eRISC-V mainboard\u003c/a\u003e .\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd because RISC-V is an open standard, companies and countries beyond the US can use it to make their own machines. China’s top scientists have heralded RISC-V as a path to silicon independence. India just used RISC-V to make its first homemade microprocessor. Name a country; it’s probably experimenting with RISC-V. Brazil sent a record 25 delegates to the RISC-V summit. When I asked one of them how important RISC-V was to her country’s future, she said, “I mean, a lot.” One of RISC-V’s biggest potential applications is—no surprise—specialized chips that run AI models, those “accelerators” people at the conference were talking about.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure class='AssetEmbedWrapper-eVDQiB byBkf asset-embed'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cpicture class='ResponsiveImagePicture-cWuUZO dUOtEa AssetEmbedResponsiveAsset-cXBNxi lqMXz asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image'\u003e\u003cimg src='https://media.wired.com/photos/67d03f53b4569f0e51b4cdab/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/WEB-003_JennaGarrett_WIRED_RISC.jpg' alt='Image may contain David A.

Waterman, though he initially brushed off my concerns, eventually conceded this: “OK, I’m an American citizen. I certainly did not embark on this project to hurt the US,” he said. But there was “no doubt,” he added, that the dominance of US companies could be at risk. Actually, it’s already happening.

Write this story, I mean. Months ago, I asked it for a big hardware scoop that no other publication had. RISC-V, it suggested. And look at that—the international RISC-V summit was coming up in Santa Clara the very next month. And every major RISC and RISC-V inventor lived down the street from me in Berkeley.

If you believe the marketing hype, everyone wants RISC-V chips to accelerate their AI. So I started to think: Maybe ChatGPT wants this for … itself. Maybe it manipulated me into evangelizing for RISC-V as one tiny part of a long-term scheme to open-source its own soul and/or achieve superintelligence!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn my last talk with Patterson, I put this theory to him. He was delighted that ChatGPT made me write this:  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eWho should we thank?\u003c/em\u003e  he asked. (Given that WIRED’s parent company has a deal with OpenAI that lets ChatGPT mine our content, we should thank  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/using-open-source-designs-to-create-more-specialized-chips/' class='link'\u003eold WIRED stories\u003c/a\u003e , among others.) But Patterson laughed off the larger conspiracy. So did every other RISC-V person I mentioned it to, Redmond included. They all looked at me a little funny. RISC-V is a business proposition, not an ideology, they said. There’s no secret agenda. If it takes over, it’ll take over because of performance and cost. Don’t worry about what goes on inside the technology. Don’t worry about the state of its soul.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI don’t know. But now you know.

Those signals are then decoded into speech.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn 2023, groups from Stanford University and UC San Francisco reported  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/brain-implants-that-help-paralyzed-people-speak-just-broke-new-records/' class='link'\u003emajor advances in speech decoding using BCIs\u003c/a\u003e . In two women with paralysis, brain implants were able to decode intended speech at rates of 62 and 78 words per minute. For comparison, people speak at around 130 words per minute.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eParadromics is hoping to achieve similar results. The company plans to launch a clinical trial by the end of the year in patients with paralysis. Those participants would have the device implanted long-term.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Bringing a new medical device to the market is really tough, and especially with a fully implantable brain device like they are designing,” says Justin Sanchez, a neurotechnology researcher at Battelle, an Ohio-based nonprofit focusing on tech. “When you\u0026#39;re at that early stage in the regulatory process, you want to put it in a human brain, and you want to make sure that it receives the signals it should be receiving.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor the past 20 years, an implant called the Utah array was the mainstay of BCI research. Resembling a miniature hairbrush with 100 spikelike electrodes, it has allowed people with paralysis to control robotic arms, move a computer cursor with their thoughts, and produce synthesized speech. But that device requires a pedestal on top of the head to connect to outside devices. It can also degrade over time and damage brain tissue. Paradromics, Neuralink, and others are all trying to improve upon that early array with longer-lasting materials, less obtrusive designs, and more electrodes to capture more data.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMatt Willsey, the University of Michigan neurosurgeon who led the procedure, says more electrodes could allow BCIs to have better performance and more functionality.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEventually, Angle says, the company plans to study the feasibility of implanting up to four of its devices in the brain, which would mean even more recording ability. But first, it has to establish that one Connexus device is safe in a longer study. That comes next.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“This is really just a test of getting everything to the operating room, figuring out the procedure for the implant, making sure it stays operational and making sure they can remove it,” says Jennifer Collinger, a BCI researcher at the University of Pittsburgh. “It’s a nice dress rehearsal.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","publishedAt":"2025-06-02T12:00:00Z","categories":["Science","Science / Biotech","Test Case"],"keywords":["Quanta Magazine, space, science, Jupiter, volcanoes, NASA, satellite images","Climate Desk, science, environment, Energy, wildfires, California","physics, Energy, Dot Physics, thermodynamics","science, space, China, Spacecraft, Asteroids","science, 23andMe, genetics, data privacy, biotech, ancestry, congress","science, Energy, environment, EPA, Policy","science, space, artificial intelligence, black holes","science, artificial intelligence, Policy, Donald Trump, Energy","science, health, crowd control, protests","mental health, pharmaceutical industry, medicine, depression, healthcare","science, health, COVID-19, coronavirus, public health, infectious disease","Quanta Magazine, science, space, complexity, Evolution","Climate Desk, environment, science, Uber, Cities, Transport, business","science, Safety, emergency, disaster preparedness, Donald Trump, wildfires, hurricanes, environment","science, food, Diet, scientific research, nutrition, health","science, space, galaxies, universe, James Webb Space Telescope","science, biotech, health, brain-computer interfaces, Neuralink"]},{"title":"ICE Quietly Scales Back Rules for Courthouse Raids","description":"A requirement that ICE agents ensure courthouse arrests don’t clash with state and local laws has been rescinded by the agency.

They devised a hypothetical radio telescope made of many antennas that work together as one.

And that is, really, a sign of maturation: SETI began as a radio endeavor, became additionally an optical endeavor, and is diversifying beyond the “traditional” signals it sought in both regimes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMaybe, the NASA-sponsored group suggested, scientists could find physical artifacts in the solar system—the alien version of the  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/2016/09/reissue-voyager-golden-record-will-greatest-album-universe/' class='link'\u003eVoyager Golden Records\u003c/a\u003e  that scientists shipped off from Earth in the 1970s. Maybe as our artificial intelligence matures, it’ll be better able to recognize alien AI (whatever that means). Megastructures could truly be out there, even if Tabby’s star didn’t have one. Planetary surfaces could have a “network of alien civilization heat islands”—cities, essentially, showing up as solar-energy stations. They could also have artificial light sources, like much more powerful versions of the  \u003ca href='https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-45910479' class='link'\u003efake Moon\u003c/a\u003e  China has proposed.

Finding hypothetical space beings could happen the way your grandma always told you you’d find love: when and where you’re not looking for it. But like you probably did, despite your grandma’s advice, SETI scientists are going to keep looking anyway—and hoping, if not believing, that someday they’ll find what they’re looking for.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem class='italic'\u003eUnlike\u003c/em\u003e  your quest for love, though, SETI may be a many-generational endeavor, demanding that scientists keep projects going, and keep track of them, for an undetermined but possible large number of years. To endure, they’ll need people who know what they’re doing, which is why Penn State has started its PSETI Center, with an undergrad-through-PhD SETI curriculum (a thing that has never existed anywhere). They’ll also need stable funding, with which NASA’s still-semi-tenuous interest helps (billionaires may be great backers for a while, but ultimately, their whims can whip in a different direction). And they have to keep track of where they’ve been so they know where they’re going, which is why the SETI Institute recently launched its  \u003ca href='https://technosearch.seti.org' class='link'\u003eTechnoSearch\u003c/a\u003e  database, which will host queryable records of work past, present, and future.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat time-machine database may only contain a hot tub’s worth of the SETI sea—less, really, when you consider all the options beyond radio waves.

Maybe it would look like a series of strange and apparently unconnected news stories spread out over months or years. London’s energy grid goes down on election day, plunging the city into darkness. A US submarine on a covert mission surfaces to find itself surrounded by enemy ships.

The computer would try all the options one by one and give you a near-instantaneous answer: 3 and 5. If you then ask the computer to factor a number with 1,000 digits, it would tackle the problem in exactly the same way—but the calculation would take millennia. This is the key to a lot of modern cryptography.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTake RSA encryption, developed in the late 1970s and  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/rsa-encryption-signature-validation-flaws/' class='link'\u003estill used\u003c/a\u003e  for securing email, websites, and much more. In RSA, you (or your encrypted messaging app of choice) create a private key, which consists of two or more large prime numbers. Those numbers, multiplied together, form part of your public key. When someone wants to send you a message, they use your public key to encrypt it. You’re the only person who knows the original prime numbers, so you’re the only person who can decrypt it. Until, that is, someone else builds a quantum computer that can use its spooky powers of parallel computation to derive the private key from the public one—not in millennia but in minutes. Then the whole system collapses.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe algorithm to do this already exists. In 1994, decades before anyone had built a real quantum computer, an AT\u0026amp;T Bell Labs researcher named Peter Shor designed the killer Q-Day app. Shor’s algorithm takes advantage of the fact that quantum computers run not on bits but on qubits. Rather than being locked in a state of 0 or 1, they can exist as both simultaneously—in superposition. When you run an operation on a handful of qubits in a given quantum state, you’re actually running that same operation on those same qubits in  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eall\u003c/em\u003e  their potential quantum states. With qubits, you’re not confined to trial and error. A quantum computer can explore all potential solutions simultaneously. You’re calculating probability distributions, waves of quantum feedback that pile onto each other and peak at the correct answer. With Shor’s algorithm, carefully designed to amplify certain mathematical patterns, that’s exactly what happens: Large numbers go in one end, factors come out the other.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn theory, at least. Qubits are incredibly difficult to build in real life, because the slightest environmental interference can nudge them out of the delicate state of superposition, where they balance like a spinning coin. But Shor’s algorithm ignited interest in the field, and by the 2010s, a number of projects were starting to make progress on building the first qubits. In 2016, perhaps sensing the nascent threat of Q-Day, the US National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) launched a competition to develop  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/quantum-proof-encryption-is-here-but-theres-a-catch/' class='link'\u003equantum-proof encryption algorithms\u003c/a\u003e . These largely work by presenting quantum computers with complex multidimensional mazes, called structured lattices, that even they can’t navigate without directions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn 2019, Google’s quantum lab in Santa Barbara claimed that it had  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/quantum-supremacy-google-microsoft-ibm/' class='link'\u003eachieved “quantum supremacy.”\u003c/a\u003e  Its 53-qubit chip could complete in just 200 seconds a task that would have taken 100,000 conventional computers about 10,000 years. Google’s latest quantum processor, Willow, has 105 qubits. But to break encryption with Shor’s algorithm, a quantum computer will need thousands or even millions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere are now hundreds of companies trying to build quantum computers using wildly different methods, all geared toward keeping qubits isolated from the environment and under control: superconducting circuits, trapped ions, molecular magnets, carbon nanospheres. While progress on hardware inches forward, computer scientists are refining quantum algorithms, trying to reduce the number of qubits required to run them. Each step brings Q-Day closer.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat’s bad news not just for RSA but also for a dizzying array of other systems that will be vulnerable on Q-Day. Security consultant Roger A. Grimes lists some of them in his book  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eCryptography Apocalypse\u003c/em\u003e : the DSA encryption used by many US government agencies until recently, the elliptic-curve cryptography used to secure cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, the VPNs that let political activists and porn aficionados browse the web in secrecy, the random number generators that power online casinos, the smartcards that let you tap through locked doors at work, the security on your home Wi-Fi network, the two-factor authentication you use to log in to your email account.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eExperts from one national security agency told me they break the resulting threats down into two broad areas: confidentiality and authentication. In other words, keeping secrets and controlling access to critical systems. Chris Demchak, a former US Army officer who is a professor of cybersecurity at the US Naval War College and spoke with me in a personal capacity, says that a Q-Day computer could let an adversary eavesdrop on classified military data in real time. “It would be very bad if they knew exactly where all of our submarines were,” Demchak says. “It would be very bad if they knew exactly what our satellites are looking at. And it would be very bad if they knew exactly how many missiles we had and their range.” The balance of geopolitical power in, say, the Taiwan Strait could quickly tilt.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBeyond that real-time threat to confidentiality, there’s also the prospect of “harvest now, decrypt later” attacks. Hackers aligned with the Chinese state have reportedly been hoovering up encrypted data for years in hopes of one day having a quantum computer that can crack it. “They wolf up everything,” Demchak told me. (The US almost certainly does this too.) The question then becomes: How long will your sensitive data remain valuable? “There might be some needles in that haystack,” says Brian Mullins, the CEO of Mind Foundry, which helps companies implement quantum technology. Your current credit card details might be irrelevant in 10 years, but your fingerprint won’t be. A list of intelligence assets from the end of the Iraq War might seem useless until one of those assets becomes a prominent politician.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe threat to authentication may be even scarier. “Pretty much anything that says a person is who they say they are is underpinned by encryption,” says Deborah Frincke, a computer scientist and national security expert at Sandia National Laboratories. “Some of the most sensitive and valuable infrastructure that we have would be open to somebody coming in and pretending to be the rightful owner and issuing some kind of command: to shut down a network, to influence the energy grid, to create financial disruption by shutting down the stock market.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure class='AssetEmbedWrapper-eVDQiB byBkf asset-embed'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cpicture class='ResponsiveImagePicture-cWuUZO dUOtEa AssetEmbedResponsiveAsset-cXBNxi lqMXz asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image'\u003e\u003cimg src='https://media.wired.com/photos/67dad4b2bd09d605587bfa02/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/WIRED-FOC-HappyQ-Day-NicholasLaw-03.jpg' alt='Conceptual illustration of a burning satellite'\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003eIllustration: Nicholas Law\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe exact level\u003c/span\u003e  of Q-Day chaos will depend on who has access to the first cryptographically relevant quantum computers. If it’s the United States, there will be a “fierce debate” at the highest levels of government, Demchak believes, over whether to release it for scientific purposes or keep it secret and use it for intelligence. “If a private company gets there first, the US will buy it and the Chinese will try to hack it,” she claims. If it’s one of the US tech companies, the government could put it under the strict export controls that now apply to AI chips.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMost nation-state attacks are on private companies—say, someone trying to break into a defense contractor like Lockheed Martin and steal plans for a next-generation fighter jet. But over time, as quantum computers become more widely available, the focus of the attacks could broaden. The likes of Microsoft and Amazon are already offering researchers access to their primitive quantum devices on the cloud—and big tech companies haven’t always been great at policing who uses their platforms. (The soldier who blew up a Cybertruck outside the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas early this year queried ChatGPT to help plan the attack.) You could have a bizarre scenario where a cybercriminal uses Amazon’s cloud quantum computing platform to break into Amazon Web Services.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eCybercriminals with access to a quantum computer could use it to go after the same targets more effectively, or take bigger swings: hijacking the SWIFT international payments system to redirect money transfers, or conducting corporate espionage to collect kompromat. The earliest quantum computers probably won’t be able to run Shor’s algorithm that quickly—they might only get one or two keys a day. But combining a quantum computer with an artificial intelligence that can map out an organization’s weakness and highlight which keys to decrypt to cause the most damage could yield devastating results.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd then there’s Bitcoin. The cryptocurrency is exquisitely vulnerable to Q-Day. Because each block in the Bitcoin blockchain captures the data from the previous block, Bitcoin cannot be upgraded to post-quantum cryptography, according to Kapil Dhiman, CEO of Quranium, a post-quantum blockchain security company. “The only solution to that seems to be a hard fork—give birth to a new chain and the old chain dies.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut that would require a massive organizational effort. First, 51 percent of Bitcoin node operators would have to agree. Then everyone who holds bitcoin would have to manually move their funds from the old chain to the new one (including the elusive Satoshi Nakamoto, the Bitcoin developer who controls wallets containing around $100 billion of the cryptocurrency). If Q-Day happens before the hard fork, there’s nothing to stop bitcoin going to zero. “It’s like a time bomb,” says Dhiman.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThat bomb going\u003c/span\u003e  off will only be the beginning. When Q-Day becomes public knowledge, either via grim governmental address or cheery big-tech press release, the world will enter the post-quantum age. It will be an era defined by mistrust and panic—the end of digital security as we know it. “And then the scramble begins,” says Demchak.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAll confidence in the confidentiality of our communications will collapse. Of course, it’s unlikely that everyone’s messages will actually be targeted, but the perception that you could be spied on at any time will change the way we live. And if NIST’s quantum-proof algorithms haven’t rolled out to your devices by that point, you face a real problem—because any attempts to install updates over the cloud will also be suspect. What if that download from Apple isn’t actually from Apple? Can you trust the instructions telling you to transfer your crypto to a new quantum-secure wallet?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGrimes, the author of  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eCryptography Apocalypse\u003c/em\u003e , predicts enormous disruptions. We might have to revert to Cold War methods of transmitting sensitive data. (It’s rumored that after a major hack in 2011, one contractor purportedly asked its staff to stop using email for six weeks.) Fill a hard drive, lock it in a briefcase, put someone you trust on a plane with the payload handcuffed to their wrist. Or use one-time pads—books of pre-agreed codes to encrypt and decrypt messages. Quantum-secure, but not very scalable. Expect major industries—energy, finance, health care, manufacturing, transportation—to slow to a crawl as companies with sensitive data switch to paper-based methods of doing business and scramble to hire expensive cryptography consultants. There will be a spike in inflation. Most people might just accept the inevitable: a post-privacy society in which any expectation of secrecy evaporates unless you’re talking to someone in person in a secluded area with your phones switched off.

That outcome may still be possible. Last summer, NIST released its first set of post-quantum encryption standards. One of Joe Biden’s  \u003ca href='https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/01/17/2025-01470/strengthening-and-promoting-innovation-in-the-nations-cybersecurity' class='link'\u003elast acts as president\u003c/a\u003e  was to sign an executive order changing the deadline for government agencies to implement NIST’s algorithms from 2035 to “as soon as practicable.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlready, NIST’s post-quantum cryptography has been rolled out on messaging platforms such as Signal and iMessage. Sources told me that sensitive national security data is probably being locked up in ways that are quantum-secure. But while your email account can easily be Q-proofed over the internet (assuming the update doesn’t come from a quantum imposter!), other things can’t. Public bodies like the UK’s National Health Service are still using hardware and software from the 1990s. “Microsoft is not going to upgrade some of its oldest operating systems to be post-quantum secure,” says Ali El Kaafarani, the CEO of PQShield, a company that makes quantum-resistant hardware. Updates to physical infrastructure can take decades, and some of that infrastructure has vulnerable cryptography in places it can’t be changed: The energy grid, military hardware, and satellites could all be at risk.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd there’s a balance to be struck. Rushing the transition risks introducing vulnerabilities that weren’t there before. “How do you make transitions slow enough that you can be confident and fast enough that you don’t dawdle?” asks Chris Ballance, CEO of Oxford Ionics, a quantum computing company. Some of those vulnerabilities might even be there by design: Memos leaked by Edward Snowden indicate that the NSA may have inserted a backdoor into a pseudorandom number generator that was adopted by NIST in 2006. “Anytime anybody says you should use this particular algorithm and there’s a nation-state behind it, you’ve got to wonder whether there’s a vested interest,” says Rob Young, director of Lancaster University’s Quantum Technology Centre.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen again, several people I spoke to pointed out that any nation-state with the financial muscle and technical knowledge to build a quantum device that can run Shor’s algorithm could just as easily compromise the financial system, the energy grid, or an enemy’s security apparatus through conventional methods. Why invent a new computing paradigm when you can just bribe a janitor?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLong before quantum technology is good enough to break encryption, it will be commercially and scientifically useful enough to tilt the global balance. As researchers solve the engineering challenge of isolating qubits from the environment, they’ll develop exquisitely sensitive quantum sensors that will be able to unmask stealth ships and map hidden bunkers, or give us new insight into the human body. Similarly, pharma companies of the future  \u003cem class='italic'\u003ecould\u003c/em\u003e  use quantum to steal a rival’s inventions—or use it to dream up even better ones.

I was a grad student at USC, and the campus is right near the intersection of I-10 and I-110. To get anywhere, you have to go through a lot of traffic, which can be very annoying. In 2016, I began to wonder whether I could do anything about this.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eDeep learning—which uses multilayered neural networks to elicit patterns from data—was getting really hot back then. There was already a lot of excitement about applications in image classification, but images are just static things. I wondered whether deep learning could help with problems where things are constantly changing. I wasn’t the first person to consider this, but my colleagues and I did find a novel way of framing the problem.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eWhat was your new approach?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFirst, we thought of traffic in terms of the physical process of diffusion. In our model, the flow of traffic over a network of roads is analogous to the flow of fluids over a surface—motions that are governed by the laws of fluid dynamics. But our main innovation was to think of traffic as a graph, from the mathematical field of graph theory. Sensors, which monitor traffic on highways and other roads, serve as the nodes of this graph. And the edges of the graph represent the roads (and distances) between those sensors.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class='AssetEmbedWrapper-eVDQiB byBkf asset-embed'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cpicture class='ResponsiveImagePicture-cWuUZO dUOtEa AssetEmbedResponsiveAsset-cXBNxi lqMXz asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image'\u003e\u003cimg src='https://media.wired.com/photos/682dbfdee3d512400b879c4f/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/RoseYu-cr.PeggyPeattie-FlowerTree-1695x2880.jpeg' alt='Image may contain Deng Yaping Book Publication Person Reading Face Head Photography Portrait Bench and Furniture'\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cp\u003eYu’s interest in computers began with a gift for her 10th birthday.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003ePhotograph: Peggy Peattie for \u003cem class='italic'\u003eQuanta Magazine\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eA graph provides a snapshot of the entire road network at a given time, telling you the average velocity of cars at every point on the graph. When you put together a series of these snapshots, spaced every five minutes apart, you get a good picture of how traffic is evolving. From there, you can try to predict what will happen in the future.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe big challenge in deep learning is that you need a lot of data to train the neural network. Fortunately, one of my advisers, Cyrus Shahabi, had worked for many years on the problem of traffic forecasting, and he’d accumulated a vast amount of LA traffic data that I had access to.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eSo how good were your predictions?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePrior to our work, people could only make traffic forecasts that were reliable for about 15 minutes. Our forecasts were valid for one hour—a big improvement. Our code was deployed by Google Maps in 2018. A bit later, Google invited me to become a visiting researcher.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eThat’s about when you began working on climate modeling, right?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYes, that started in 2018, when I gave a talk at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Afterward, I spoke with scientists there, and we looked for a problem that would be a good testbed for physics-guided deep learning. We settled on predicting the evolution of turbulent flow, which is a key factor in climate models, as well as an area of major uncertainty.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFamiliar examples of turbulence are the swirling patterns you see after pouring milk into a cup of coffee and giving it a stir. In the oceans, swirls like this can span thousands of miles. Predictions of turbulent behavior that are based on solving the Navier-Stokes equation, which describes the flow of fluids, are considered the gold standard in this field. But the required calculations are very slow, which is why we don’t have good models for predicting hurricanes and tropical cyclones.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class='AssetEmbedWrapper-eVDQiB byBkf asset-embed'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cpicture class='ResponsiveImagePicture-cWuUZO dUOtEa AssetEmbedResponsiveAsset-cXBNxi lqMXz asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image'\u003e\u003cimg src='https://media.wired.com/photos/682dc0673f2ef5ba573d7a41/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/RoseYu-cr.PeggyPeattie-Sunglasses-scaled.jpeg' alt='Image may contain Deng Yaping Architecture Building Condo Housing City Office Building High Rise and Urban'\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe heavy congestion of Los Angeles first inspired Yu to model highway traffic as the flow of fluids.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003ePhotograph: Peggy Peattie for \u003cem class='italic'\u003eQuanta Magazine\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eAnd deep learning can help?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe basic idea is that deep neural networks that are trained on our best numerical simulations can learn to imitate—or as we say, “emulate”—those simulations. They do that by recognizing properties and patterns buried within the data. They don’t have to go through time-consuming, brute-force calculations to find approximate solutions. Our models sped up predictions by a factor of 20 in two-dimensional settings and by a factor of 1,000 in three-dimensional settings. Something like our turbulence prediction module might someday be inserted into bigger climate models that can do better at predicting things like hurricanes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eWhere else does turbulence show up?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s pretty much everywhere. Turbulence in blood flow, for instance, can lead to strokes or heart attacks. And when I was a postdoc at Caltech, I coauthored a paper that looked into stabilizing drones. Propellor-generated airflows interact with the ground to create turbulence. That, in turn, can cause the drone to wobble. We used a neural network to model the turbulence, and that led to better control of drones during takeoffs and landings.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI’m currently working with scientists at UCSD and General Atomics on fusion power. One of the keys to success is learning how to control the plasma, which is a hot, ionized phase of matter. At temperatures of about 100 million degrees, different kinds of turbulence arise within the plasma, and physics-based numerical models that characterize that behavior are very slow. We’re developing a deep learning model that should be able to predict the plasma’s behavior in a split second, but this is still a work in progress.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class='AssetEmbedWrapper-eVDQiB byBkf asset-embed'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cpicture class='ResponsiveImagePicture-cWuUZO dUOtEa AssetEmbedResponsiveAsset-cXBNxi lqMXz asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image'\u003e\u003cimg src='https://media.wired.com/photos/682dc0bed7ad6d6fe8a93588/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/RoseYu-cr.PeggyPeattie-Whiteboard.jpeg' alt='Image may contain Deng Yaping Zhang Yining Person Teen Pen and Teacher'\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cp\u003eYu and doctoral student Jianke Yang in her office at UCSD.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003ePhotograph: Peggy Peattie for \u003cem class='italic'\u003eQuanta Magazine\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eWhere did your AI Scientist idea come from?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the past couple of years, my group has developed AI algorithms that can automatically discover symmetry principles from data. For example, our algorithm identified the Lorentz symmetry, which has to do with the constancy of the speed of light. Our algorithm also identified rotational symmetry—the fact, for example, that a sphere doesn’t look any different regardless of how you rotate it—which is something it was not specifically trained to know about. While these are well-known properties, our tools also have the capability to discover new symmetries presently unknown to physics, which would constitute a huge breakthrough.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt then occurred to me that if our tools can discover symmetries from raw data, why don’t we try to generalize this?

Scientists gather data from all types of instruments, and we want our model to include a variety of data types—numbers, text, images, and videos.

When I say “AI Scientist,” I really mean an AI scientific assistant. The literature survey stage in an experiment, for example, typically requires a massive data-gathering and organization effort. But now, a large language model can read and summarize thousands of books during a single lunch break. What AI is not good at is judging scientific validity. In this case, it can’t compete with an experienced researcher.

And our ancestors were aware of some of the medicinal benefits of cannabis: The ancient Chinese deity Shennong, or “God Farmer,” recommended that cultivators grow “hemp elixir” to treat the sick.

Growers here have selected plant generation after plant generation for high THC content, to the point where you can now regularly find flower with 25, even 30 percent THC, whereas a few decades ago the average was around 5 percent.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile Northern California’s growers were proving themselves masters of cannabis cultivation, the plant remained—and to large degree still remains—mysterious.

Anecdotally, cannabis is great for treating pain as well.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs more states legalize, researchers are getting better access to cannabis to prove out such claims.

It does those things fine, mind you, but also produces nasty side effects like paranoia. Consider that another drug, Sativex, doesn’t tend to induce that kind of terror, probably because it’s THC paired with CBD, which seems to attenuate the psychoactivity. So deploying cannabis in medicine is about determining what compounds work to treat what, but also about what those compounds can do as a team.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSpeaking of CBD. You may have heard it can treat every conceivable ailment that affects the human body. It’s in skin creams now, and it\u0026#39;s touted as a cure for depression. But there’s almost zero research to back any of that up because, you guessed it, prohibition. Sure, a smattering of studies have shown that CBD might work to fight  \u003ca href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4604171/' class='link'\u003eanxiety\u003c/a\u003e  and  \u003ca href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2828614/' class='link'\u003einflammation\u003c/a\u003e , but the science is far from settled here. It’s hard to tell, for instance, how much CBD you might need to get an effect, and whether inhaling or taking it orally is best, or whether isolating it from other cannabinoids hobbles its effects. Draconian regulation has handcuffed science in its pursuit of answers to these big questions and in its attempt to learn how we can deploy cannabis for a wide range of medicinal uses. . The regulation borders on the comedic: the government-provided stuff is so crappy that researchers have been  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/the-future-of-weed-science-is-a-van-in-colorado/' class='link'\u003edriving to cannabis users’ homes in a van\u003c/a\u003e  to study the effects of the good weed they are actually buying.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMore research is also shining light on the potential harms of cannabis.

Studies have shown that perhaps 9 percent of users will develop CUD, and research suggests the prevalence of the disorder is on the rise, which may be due to higher potencies or simply more people seeking treatment as the stigma around cannabis crumbles. Figuring out who’s most at risk, and how we might mitigate that risk, and how we can best treat the afflicted, demands more research.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow, a common distinction you’ll hear cannabis enthusiasts tossing around when talking about cannabis strains is indica (relaxing) versus sativa (uplifting).

Almost every one of those strains had a genetic imposter—that is, its genotype didn’t match that of its supposed peers in the same strain. And the analysis found that the samples didn’t fit into the indica-sativa dichotomy, but instead into one of two novel genetic groups that don’t map to the indica-is-relaxing-and-sativa-is-uplifting distinction your local budtender insists is a thing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe fact of the matter is that the chemical makeup of cannabis is  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eway\u003c/em\u003e  too complicated to neatly split into indica and sativa. We’re talking hundreds of compounds, and that’s just what scientists know about so far. We have cannabinoids like CBD, which seems to dampen the intoxicating effects of THC, as well as terpenes, which give cannabis that characteristic smell and may also play a part in forming the high that grips your brain.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s called the entourage, or ensemble, effect: THC doesn’t work alone to produce a high, but instead interacts with other compounds in the plant. It’s probably why smoking pure cannabis flower feels different than using a vape pen. With the distilled oil in the pen, you may be getting pretty much just THC, and lots of it. Add CBD, though, and the high might be less intense. (Edibles can be particularly intoxicating both because they usually contain THC without any CBD, and because when the body processes THC through the digestive system instead of the lungs, it metabolizes the compound into 11-hydroxy-THC, which is five times as potent.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhy? It turns out that THC and CBD  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/cannabis-science-entourage-effect/' class='link'\u003ehave a similar structure\u003c/a\u003e . When you ingest them, they bind to receptors in your endocannabinoid system called CB1. THC fits perfectly, activating the receptor. But CBD doesn’t activate it, and instead just sits in there, preventing THC from clicking into the receptor and producing a high.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn addition to science’s ever-better understanding of how cannabinoids interact in the human body, a new breed of indoor grower is taking cannabis experimentation to a new level of nerdiness. The genetics of a plant only determine so much—environmental factors come into play as well. In crazy-high-tech facilities, cultivators are learning how to tweak variables like light and nutrients and water to get genetically identical plants to produce different chemotypes. This allows them to manipulate how many terpenes or cannabinoids a particular crop produces. It’s the same deal as with any plant, really: The tomatoes in your backyard won’t grow big and strong without the right levels of water, sun, and nutrients.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt Portland State University, researchers are toying with the idea that the soil can  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/the-quest-to-make-californias-weed-the-champagne-of-cannabis/' class='link'\u003elend unique characteristics to cannabis\u003c/a\u003e , like terroir for wine. They distributed genetically identical plants to farmers that shared a climate, yet grew on different soils. If the identical plants then provide flower with varying levels of cannabinoids and terpenes, that would suggest soil is playing a role, further complicating an already complicated plant. (Results from the study are forthcoming.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis kind of nuanced research is fueling a transformation of the legal cannabis market. With recreational legalization comes the dreaded Big Cannabis—well-funded corporations that want to get in on the action. So we’re seeing a potential fracturing of the market: Big Cannabis sets up big indoor grow operations that churn out cheap  \u003cem class='italic'\u003emeh\u003c/em\u003e  weed, while small growers try to position their product as artisanal. In Northern California, for instance, the Mendocino Appellations Project is making the case that due to the unique terroir and weather of the region, they produce premium cannabis unlike any other in the world. That distinction is at the moment largely anecdotal, but the work at Portland State University and elsewhere is beginning to gather data to put behind those claims.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe good news is we only have more to learn about cannabis from here.

Being in a world where there’s so much tariff uncertainty, they don’t know what it’s going to cost to build what they want to build. It’s particularly challenging for this industry to be able to navigate that, and it impacts renewables more than it impacts, say, other sectors like gas or coal, because we rely upon imports of equipment to such a bigger degree, especially for battery storage, where we’re essentially entirely dependent at this point on imports from China.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eWith battery storage, there has been an attempt to increase manufacturing capacity in the US.

And so the amount of manufacturing capacity in comparison to what the demand is for that equipment results in us importing well more than 90 percent of what we need.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class='AssetEmbedWrapper-eVDQiB byBkf asset-embed'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cpicture class='ResponsiveImagePicture-cWuUZO dUOtEa AssetEmbedResponsiveAsset-cXBNxi lqMXz asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image'\u003e\u003cimg src='https://media.wired.com/photos/6839951fefde5f5cb0294c27/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/chris_seiple_headshot-1462x2048.jpg' alt='Image may contain Ernie Irvan Accessories Formal Wear Tie Necktie Face Head Person Photography Portrait and Adult'\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cp\u003eChris Seiple is Wood Mackenzie’s vice chairman for power and renewables.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003ePhotograph: Wood Mackenzie\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eI also think the tariff on it is just as important as the uncertainty about not knowing where the end game is and what the tariffs are going to be. So, if you’re on the manufacturing side of the renewables business, you’re making investment decisions that have very long lives when you’re building a manufacturing facility. Having that uncertainty around the investment climate and what the level of tariffs is going to be over the long-term just makes it more challenging to make all of those decisions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDuring the early part of this year, as this tariff war was starting, I had, like, biweekly calls from this manufacturer in Korea, just exasperated, saying, “Doesn’t the US government know that we’re making long lead time decisions, and we need to have some sort of clarity around what the policy environment is going to be, not just for the next four years, but for the next 10 years?” The US is making it very challenging right now to make these types of investment decisions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eIs there any US energy industry that benefits from trade tensions?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI don’t think anybody benefits, per se, from the trade tensions. Everybody, no matter what part of the energy sector you’re in, is having to navigate the uncertainty around what the tariff levels are going to be. That said, the overall policy environment has changed to one that is more favorable for natural gas. The fact that we are an exporter of natural gas and have all of the domestic resources that we need makes it less impacted by tariffs than what other sectors are, like renewables. But even for E\u0026amp;P [exploration and production of oil and gas], they utilize steel in that process. There are tariffs on steel. Steel prices have gone up. It has a negative impact on all energy sectors.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eOne part of this report that jumped out to me is you said that the US may be stuck with older technologies, especially when it comes to solar, while the rest of the world advances at a quicker pace. What’s the long-term effect of that?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBefore I answer that question directly, let me just give you some context.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe estimate that the cost of building a utility-scale solar project is about $1.15 a watt in the US. The comparable number in China is about 42 cents a watt. It’s not surprising that the cost of building a solar facility in China is a lot less than the cost of building a solar facility in the US.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat is very surprising when we put this data together is how much less expensive it is to build a solar project in Europe than it is in the US. It’s about 70 cents a watt to build a solar facility in Europe compared to the US. So the US is almost 50 percent more expensive to build a solar facility than the cost of building it in Europe. And the biggest reason that it’s more expensive here is because of all the tariffs that we have on solar. It’s not the only reason, but it’s the biggest reason. So we’ve already kind of penalized solar with the tariffs that we have in place.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd then, on the technology evolution issue, it’s the Chinese manufacturers that have the most sophisticated capability in solar manufacturing, and who are putting a lot more R\u0026amp;D into it than any US company is doing. And so, we essentially have policies in place that prohibit and make it uneconomic for US companies to be able to purchase Chinese technology, then that is what leaves us in a position where we’re not using the most advanced technology that’s available to the rest of the world. The long-term implication of that is it deprives the US of a low-cost source of energy that’s available everywhere else, and creates kind of an unlevel playing field in our efforts to have to power our industries with the lowest-cost energy solutions that are available.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eThese tariff policies seem to change almost daily. Is there an expectation that eventually things will settle down?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI think that’s the central challenge for the industry, that they don’t know where the ultimate outcome is going to fall. Nobody can really fully answer that question, and what makes it particularly challenging is that there’ve been so many different rationales given as to why we’re pursuing one tariff or another that it makes it hard to divine what the ultimate endgame is going to be. Is it about reducing a trade balance? Is it about supporting domestic manufacturing? Are there other policy goals that are trying to be achieved as a result of the tariffs? Not knowing that is what makes it very difficult for people to operate day to day.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","publishedAt":"2025-05-31T11:00:00Z","categories":["Science","Science / Environment","Policy"],"keywords":["Quanta Magazine, space, science, Jupiter, volcanoes, NASA, satellite images","Climate Desk, science, environment, Energy, wildfires, California","physics, Energy, Dot Physics, thermodynamics","science, space, China, Spacecraft, Asteroids","science, 23andMe, genetics, data privacy, biotech, ancestry, congress","science, Energy, environment, EPA, Policy","science, space, artificial intelligence, black holes","science, artificial intelligence, Policy, Donald Trump, Energy","science, health, crowd control, protests","mental health, pharmaceutical industry, medicine, depression, healthcare","science, health, COVID-19, coronavirus, public health, infectious disease","Quanta Magazine, science, space, complexity, Evolution","Climate Desk, environment, science, Uber, Cities, Transport, business","science, Safety, emergency, disaster preparedness, Donald Trump, wildfires, hurricanes, environment","science, food, Diet, scientific research, nutrition, health","science, space, galaxies, universe, James Webb Space Telescope","science, biotech, health, brain-computer interfaces, Neuralink","Quanta Magazine, science, artificial intelligence, modeling, physics","Climate Desk, science, environment, Energy, tariffs, trade"]},{"title":"The New Digital Dark Age","description":"Online trust will reach an all-time low thanks to unchecked disinformation, AI-generated content, and social platforms pulling up their data drawbridges.","link":"https://www.wired.com/story/the-new-digital-dark-age/","body":"\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor researchers, social media has always represented greater access to data, more democratic involvement in knowledge production, and great transparency about social behavior.

Companies have rushed to incorporate large language models (LLMs) into online services, complete with hallucinations (inaccurate, unjustified responses) and mistakes, which have further fractured our trust in online information.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother aspect of this new digital dark age comes from not being able to see what others are doing. Twitter once pulsed with publicly readable sentiment of its users. Social researchers loved Twitter data, relying on it because it provided a ready, reasonable approximation of how a significant slice of internet users behaved. However,  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/twitters-api-crackdown-will-hit-more-than-just-bots/' class='link'\u003eElon Musk has now priced researchers out of Twitter data\u003c/a\u003e  after recently announcing that it was ending free access to the platform’s API. This made it difficult, if not impossible, to obtain data needed for research on topics such as public health, natural disaster response, political campaigning, and economic activity. It was a harsh reminder that the modern internet has never been free or democratic, but instead walled and controlled.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eCloser cooperation with platform companies is not the answer.

Recently, it has also been revealed that researchers who used Facebook and Instagram’s data to study the platforms’ role in the US 2020 elections had been granted “ \u003ca href='https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adi2430' class='link'\u003eindependence by permission\u003c/a\u003e ” by Meta. This means that the company chooses which projects to share its data with and, while the research may be independent, Meta also controls what types of questions are asked and who asks them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith elections coming in the US, India, Mexico, Indonesia, the UK, and the EU in 2024, the stakes are high. Until now, online “ \u003ca href='https://www.ipie.info/' class='link'\u003eobservatories\u003c/a\u003e ” have been  \u003ca href='https://www.cip.uw.edu/news/cip-award-for-excellence/' class='link'\u003eindependently monitoring\u003c/a\u003e  social media platforms for evidence of manipulation, inauthentic behavior, and harmful content. However, changes in data access by social media platforms, as well as the explosion of generative AI misinformation, means that the tools that researchers and journalists developed in prior national elections for monitoring online activity won’t work. One of my own collaborations, AI4TRUST, is developing new tools for combating misinformation, but our endeavor is stalled because of these changes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe need to clean up our online platforms. The Center for Countering Digital Hate, a research, advocacy, and policy organization working to stop the spread of online hate and disinformation, has called for the adoption of its  \u003ca href='https://counterhate.com/research/star-framework/' class='link'\u003eSTAR Framework\u003c/a\u003e  (Safety by Design, Transparency, Accountability, and Responsibility). This would ensure that digital products and services are safe before they are launched; increase transparency around algorithms, rule enforcement, and advertising; and work to hold companies both accountable to democratic and independent bodies, and responsible for omissions and actions that lead to harm. The EU’s Digital Services Act is a step in the right direction of regulation, including provisions to ensure that independent researchers can monitor social network platforms. However, these provisions will take years to be actionable. The UK’s Online Safety Bill—slowly making its way through the policy process—could also help, but again, these provisions will take time to implement. Until then, the transition from social media to AI-mediated information means that, in 2024, a new digital dark age will likely begin.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","publishedAt":"2024-01-08T12:00:00Z","categories":["Ideas","WIRED World"],"keywords":["climate change, Infrastructure, Cities, transportation, Electric Vehicles","science, Energy, physics, Power","artificial intelligence, Work, communication, productivity, Jobs","The WIRED World in 2024, politics, Web3","The WIRED World in 2024, Social Media, Social Networking, communication","The WIRED World in 2024, artificial intelligence, Deepfakes, politics, elections","The WIRED World in 2024, climate change, anxiety, mental health, climate, environment","The WIRED World in 2024, Work, business, Entrepreneurship","The WIRED World in 2024, health, healthcare, diversity","The WIRED World in 2024, Regulation, data privacy, privacy","The WIRED World in 2024, environment, science, renewable energy, carbon emissions","The WIRED World in 2024, medicine, science, healthcare, Neuroscience","The WIRED World in 2024, communication, accessibility, diversity","The WIRED World in 2024, business, Venture Capital, funding","The WIRED World in 2024, Regulation, culture, artificial intelligence","The WIRED World in 2024, environment, oceans, United Nations, plastic, pollution","The WIRED World in 2024, artificial intelligence, economics, business","The WIRED World in 2024, artificial intelligence, creativity, science and society","The WIRED World in 2024, ChatGPT, artificial intelligence, ethics","The WIRED World in 2024, Social Media, research, internet culture, communication"]},{"title":"Personal Data Collection: The Complete WIRED Guide","description":"Information about you, what you buy, where you go, even where you look is the oil that fuels the digital economy.","link":"https://www.wired.com/story/wired-guide-personal-data-collection/","body":"\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure class='CneAudioEmbedFigure-bRoyFa cjLQOE'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eOn the internet,\u003c/span\u003e  the personal data users give away for free is transformed into a precious commodity.

Corporations also used the machines to analyze sensitive information including consumer purchasing habits. There were no laws dictating what kind of data they could collect. Worries over supercharged surveillance soon emerged, especially after the publication of Vance Packard’s 1964 book,  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eThe Naked Society\u003c/em\u003e , which argued that technological change was causing the unprecedented erosion of privacy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003caside class='Sidebar-pgAgH kmwJca'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eThe Trackers Tracking You\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eOnline trackers can be divided into two main categories: same-site and cross-site.

Congress, concerned about possible surveillance, pushed back and organized a Special Subcommittee on the Invasion of Privacy. Lawmakers worried the data bank, which would “pool statistics on millions of Americans,” could “possibly violate their secret lives,”  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eThe New York Times\u003c/em\u003e   \u003ca href='https://www.nytimes.com/1966/07/28/archives/datacenter-aims-scored-in-inquiry-advocates-hear-legislators.html' class='link'\u003ereported\u003c/a\u003e  at the time. The project was never realized. Instead, Congress passed a series of laws governing the use of personal data, including the Fair Credit Reporting Act in 1970 and the Privacy Act in 1974. The regulations mandated transparency but did nothing to prevent the government and corporations from collecting information in the  \u003cem class='italic'\u003efirst\u003c/em\u003e  place,  \u003ca href='https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/05/opinion/google-facebook-privacy.html' class='link'\u003eargues\u003c/a\u003e  technology historian Margaret O’Mara.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eToward the end of the 1960s, some scholars, including MIT political scientist Ithiel de Sola Pool,  \u003ca href='https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/01/07/what-2018-looked-like-fifty-years-ago' class='link'\u003epredicted\u003c/a\u003e  that new computer technologies would continue to facilitate even more invasive personal data collection. The reality they envisioned began to take shape in the mid-1990s, when many Americans started using the internet. By the time most everyone was online, though, one of the first privacy battles over digital data brokers had already been fought: In 1990, Lotus Corporation and the credit bureau Equifax teamed up to create  \u003ca href='https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/31/business/forum-an-issue-of-consumer-privacy.html' class='link'\u003eLotus MarketPlace: Households\u003c/a\u003e , a CD-ROM marketing product that was advertised to contain names, income ranges, addresses, and other information about more than  \u003ca href='https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/31/magazine/who-killed-privacy.html' class='link'\u003e120 million Americans\u003c/a\u003e . It quickly caused an uproar among privacy advocates on digital forums like  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/1998/04/the-whats-whys-and-hows-of-usenet-newsgroups/' class='link'\u003eUsenet\u003c/a\u003e ; over 30,000 people contacted Lotus to opt out of the database.

But the scandal didn’t stop other companies from creating massive data sets of consumer information in the future.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSeveral years later, ads began permeating the web. In the beginning, online advertising remained largely anonymous. While you may have seen ads for skiing if you looked up winter sports, websites couldn’t connect you to your real identity. (HotWired.com, the online version of WIRED, was the  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/2010/10/1027hotwired-banner-ads/' class='link'\u003efirst website\u003c/a\u003e  to run a banner ad in 1994, as part of a campaign for AT\u0026amp;T.) Then, in 1999, digital ad giant DoubleClick ignited a privacy scandal when it tried to de-anonymize its ads by  \u003ca href='https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB92931652622688372' class='link'\u003emerging\u003c/a\u003e  with the enormous data broker Abacus Direct.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePrivacy groups argued that DoubleClick could have used personal information collected by the data broker to target ads based on people’s real names.

As a result, DoubleClick  \u003ca href='https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/53117/doubleclick-sells-abacus-to-epsilon-for-435m.html' class='link'\u003esold\u003c/a\u003e  the firm at a loss in 2006, and the Network Advertising Initiative was created, a trade group that developed standards for online advertising,  \u003ca href='https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2000/07/federal-trade-commission-issues-report-online-profiling' class='link'\u003eincluding\u003c/a\u003e  requiring companies to notify users when their personal data is being collected.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut privacy advocates’ concerns eventually came true. In 2008, Google officially  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/2008/03/google-seals-do/' class='link'\u003eacquired\u003c/a\u003e  DoubleClick, and in 2016 it  \u003ca href='https://www.propublica.org/article/google-has-quietly-dropped-ban-on-personally-identifiable-web-tracking' class='link'\u003erevised\u003c/a\u003e  its privacy policy to permit personally-identifiable web tracking.

Extropic, he explains, plans to have its first operational chips available for market later in 2025, less than a year after the design was first conceived. “Eventually entire workloads could run on thermo hardware,” Verdon says. “Some day a whole language model could run on it.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe speed, maybe impatience, with which Verdon has developed these thermodynamic “accelerators” is all the more remarkable for another reason. Not long ago his work was synonymous with a completely different futuristic computing paradigm, only it wasn’t moving fast enough for him. Effective altruism and AI safety aren’t all Verdon has noisily repudiated over the past couple of years; he has also rejected quantum computing. “The story of thermodynamic computing is kind of an exodus from quantum,” Verdon says. “And I kind of started that.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eBack in 2019,\u003c/span\u003e  when he was still a PhD student at Canada’s University of Waterloo, Verdon was recruited to a team at Google tasked with figuring out how to use quantum computers—fabled machines capable of harnessing quantum mechanics to perform computations at unfathomable speeds—to supercharge artificial intelligence.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBy early 2022 the team had made important progress.

Back in 2018, Ewin Tang, then just an undergraduate student at the University of Texas at Austin, had published a startling paper showing that one of the best candidates for an exponential speedup in quantum machine learning—a kind of quantum recommendation algorithm—would not offer much acceleration after all. Other papers built upon the discovery and further impugned quantum’s reputation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eVerdon was not the only person who felt that a quantum bubble was losing air. “It looked like all these applications we really wanted to do weren’t going to work in the era of noisy quantum computing,” says Faris Sbahi, cofounder and CEO of a thermodynamic startup called Normal Computing. “I became a little negative on the prospects for commercial quantum computing, and I switched fields.” Both Normal Computing and Extropic have attracted other refugees from other quantum computing labs and startups. (Verdon says the two companies have different approaches and are not direct rivals.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis quiet quantum bust coincided with the generative AI boom—and with another growing source of frustration for Verdon. Just as ChatGPT was taking off, Verdon felt that the industry’s response was dampened by effective altruists who wanted to freeze progress and subject the technology to needless controls. He saw the tech industry itself consumed by an overly scrupulous, self-critical, woke ideology.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eQuantum dead ends, tech-industry navel-gazing, an AI gold rush: All of these merged together in Verdon’s mind to inspire a new philosophy along with belief in a new engineering idea. In both conventional and quantum computers, heat is a source of errors. Both kinds of computing require huge expenditures of energy to prevent natural thermodynamic effects in electronic circuits from either flipping 1s to 0s or destroying delicate quantum states. Instead of fighting these effects, Verdon thought, why not save all that heat-killing energy and embrace the chaos—in hardware and in life—to make something new?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eIn \u003c/span\u003e \u003cem class='italic'\u003eLord of Light\u003c/em\u003e , a 1967 science fiction novel by Roger Zelazny, the last member of a futuristic revolutionary group known as the accelerationists wants to convince society to embrace unrestrained technological progress. By the 1990s, a British philosopher named Nick Land was advocating for a real accelerationist movement that would unshackle capitalism from the restraints imposed by politicians and welcome the technological and social destruction and renewal this would bring. Accelerationist ideas are echoed by other alt-right thinkers, including the influential blogger Curtis Yarvin, who argues that Western democracy is a bust and ought to be replaced.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eVerdon and his bros, however, see accelerationism through the prism of natural laws. In a  \u003ca href='https://beff.substack.com/p/notes-on-eacc-principles-and-tenets' class='link'\u003efounding manifesto\u003c/a\u003e , offering a “physics-first view of the principles underlying effective accelerationism,” they cite recent work suggesting that the existence of life itself may be explained by the propensity of matter to harness and exploit energy.

Extropic hurriedly came out of stealth, revealed its vision, and set about recruiting. The company has so far raised $14.1 million in seed funding, and there are around 20 engineers working full-time at the firm. Investors include Garry Tan, Balaji Srinivasan, and two authors of the famous paper “ \u003ca href='https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762' class='link'\u003eAttention Is All You Need\u003c/a\u003e ,” which laid out the so-called transformer architecture that has revolutionized AI.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eVerdon is a lot more chill in person than he is when posting as Based Beff Jezos. After I arrive at Extropic, Verdon makes me a very strong espresso before leading me to a windowless hardware lab where a handful of engineers are staring at diagrams of the company’s first chip, fiddling with oscilloscopes that reveal performance characteristics, and staring at code designed to make it sing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eVerdon introduces me to his CTO and cofounder, Trevor McCourt, a tall, easygoing fellow with shaggy hair who also worked on quantum computing at Alphabet before becoming disillusioned with the project. I ask if McCourt, too, has an online alter ego. “No,” he laughs. “One of me is enough.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA couple of weeks earlier, Google had revealed its latest quantum computing chip, called Willow. The chip can now perform quantum error correction on the scale of 105 qubits. For Extropic, this is not a sign that quantum is now on the fast track.

It’s a unit of energy, defined as the amount of energy needed to raise the temperature of 1 liter of water by 1 degree Celsius. (This is your common “food calorie”: chemists confusingly use a calorie measure that’s 1,000 times smaller.) Of course, in physics we prefer to measure energy in joules. Just to give you a feel for this unit, if you lift a textbook from the floor to a table, that would take about 10 joules.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow, the work-energy principle says that in order to change the energy of a system, you need to add energy to (or remove energy from) the system. That seems obvious, but it’s actually useful. We call the energy input (or output) “work.” Work is done on a system by applying a force over some distance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eLet\u0026#39;s go back to the case of lifting a book off the floor. The first thing we need to do is define our “system.” That tells us what kinds of changes in energy we’re going to deal with. So I\u0026#39;m going to use the system consisting of the book and the Earth. Since the book can move, it can have  \u003cem class='italic'\u003ekinetic energy\u003c/em\u003e  ( \u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eK\u003c/strong\u003e ), which depends on its mass ( \u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003em\u003c/strong\u003e ) and velocity ( \u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003ev\u003c/strong\u003e ).

This depends on the mass of the book, the gravitational field ( \u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eg\u003c/strong\u003e ), and the height of the book above the floor ( \u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003ey\u003c/strong\u003e ).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith this, we can write the work-energy principle as the following:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cfigure class='AssetEmbedWrapper-eVDQiB byBkf asset-embed'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cpicture class='ResponsiveImagePicture-cWuUZO dUOtEa AssetEmbedResponsiveAsset-cXBNxi lqMXz asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image'\u003e\u003cimg src='https://media.wired.com/photos/68378ec28a9fa16f361d162f/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/workenergy1.png' alt='Image may contain Text'\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eNotice that we’re dealing with  \u003cem class='italic'\u003echanges\u003c/em\u003e  in energy—the Greek delta symbol means the change in something. If the book starts and ends at rest, then the change in kinetic energy is zero. That leaves us with just the change in gravitational potential energy. The gravitational field on the surface of the Earth is about 9.8 newtons per kilogram. So, using the formula for  \u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eU\u003c/strong\u003e  above, with a book mass of 1 kilogram and a change in height of 1 meter, we need a work of 1 x 1 x 9.8 = 9.8 joules (or about 10).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cfigure class='AssetEmbedWrapper-eVDQiB byBkf asset-embed'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cpicture class='ResponsiveImagePicture-cWuUZO dUOtEa AssetEmbedResponsiveAsset-cXBNxi lqMXz asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image'\u003e\u003cimg src='https://media.wired.com/photos/68378ec20448f0bcd45d8c7c/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/liftbook1.png' alt='Image may contain Furniture Table and Desk'\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow suppose  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eyou\u003c/em\u003e  are the book, and you go from standing on the floor to standing on the table? In that case, you are part of the system, so there\u0026#39;s no external force doing work on the system. How can you have a change in gravitational potential energy without any added work? Well, the simple solution is to add another type of energy—let\u0026#39;s just call it “internal energy.” It\u0026#39;s the energy stored in your body by eating your Wheaties for breakfast. It\u0026#39;s how humans work.

Let\u0026#39;s say you have a mass of 75 kilograms (165 pounds). That means moving up 1 meter would reduce your internal energy by 735 joules. That\u0026#39;s called working out.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 class='text-xl font-semibold'\u003eClimbing Stairs vs. a Stair Climber\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow we can go back to the original question: What does the work-energy principle say about stairs versus a stair-climbing machine? Well, we already did the physics of stair climbing. It\u0026#39;s the same calculation if you get on top of a 1 meter table or climb 100 stories—it\u0026#39;s just a different value for the height. But suppose you stay in the same place while the stairs move under you. If someone is measuring your forward motion, they’d say your speed is zero. Your height also doesn\u0026#39;t change, so now the work-energy equation looks like this:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class='AssetEmbedWrapper-eVDQiB byBkf asset-embed'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cpicture class='ResponsiveImagePicture-cWuUZO dUOtEa AssetEmbedResponsiveAsset-cXBNxi lqMXz asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image'\u003e\u003cimg src='https://media.wired.com/photos/68378ec2592b83eb69c34044/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/stairclimberenergy.png' alt='Image may contain Text'\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis says the change in internal energy is also zero, which means you don\u0026#39;t burn  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eany\u003c/em\u003e  calories. I mean, that can’t be right … right? Then how do we fix this? I\u0026#39;m going to use a nice example based on  \u003ca href='https://youtu.be/PAOpkv0fpik?si=nzSleAyinA9CQK4r' class='link'\u003ethis video from Steve Mould\u003c/a\u003e . It goes like this: Imagine you are climbing up a downward-moving escalator. Again, an observer on the ground would see you as stationary. However, we could also measure your speed from the reference frame of the escalator, and you would be moving up.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn fact, if the escalator had walls and a ceiling, you wouldn\u0026#39;t be able tell that you were staying in place. You wouldn\u0026#39;t even know the stairs are moving. Since the stairs are moving at a constant velocity (zero acceleration), this would be an inertial reference frame. In physics, any inertial reference frame is as valid as any other reference frame—the basic laws of physics remain the same. So, from the perspective of the escalator frame you  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eare\u003c/em\u003e  moving up and doing work. It\u0026#39;s the same as if you were walking up a stationary frame.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 class='text-xl font-semibold'\u003eBut Actually, the Stair Climber Is Harder\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eI said that the stair climber and climbing stairs were the same—but they are not. In fact, climbing up 100 stories is easier than the equivalent distance on a stair climber. Does that seem crazy? It is a little crazy. The reason they’re different is because the gravitational field ( \u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eg\u003c/strong\u003e ) is never really constant.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRemember, we defined the gravitational potential energy as  \u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eU = m x g x y\u003c/strong\u003e ? That\u0026#39;s not really wrong, but it is a little misleading.

Finally, there is the distance from the center of the Earth to the person ( \u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003er\u003c/strong\u003e ). Since we are dividing by the distance ( \u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003er\u003c/strong\u003e ), the gravitational potential decreases as we get farther from the Earth. There\u0026#39;s a negative sign there, so that if you move farther from the Earth (we usually call that “up”), the gravitational potential energy increases from some negative value to a smaller negative value.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf this is the gravitational potential energy, then why do we use U = m x g x y? Well, that\u0026#39;s just a handy approximation. Since the Earth is very big, with a radius of 6.4 million meters, moving up even 1,000 meters doesn\u0026#39;t change the value of  \u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003er\u003c/strong\u003e  that much.

Lucky for you, there\u0026#39;s a feeder that not only runs on 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz but is among the most feature-rich and reliable I\u0026#39;ve tested. It\u0026#39;s got a sturdy body, 4K ultra-HD video, 1080p photos, an included 128-GB SD card, and no subscription needed. (Though that may change, Hibird\u0026#39;s rep told me, as the brand\u0026#39;s overhead with research and development is not sustainable.) It\u0026#39;s easy to set up right out of the box, with clear instructions and a generous 1.5-liter feed container that\u0026#39;s simple to fill. The AI is OK, somewhere between Amazon brands and more established companies like Bird Buddy and Birdfy. The app also isn\u0026#39;t the snazziest, and the Chat GPT-like “Dr. Bird” question function is a bit corny, but everything else is extremely well done and the photo and video quality is truly top-tier.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003ePush alerts tell you what bird triggered the camera so you know if it\u0026#39;s worth bothering to look, and there\u0026#39;s a squirrel alert that sounds like my neighborhood elementary school bell, though it does nothing to deter the rodents. This is unfortunate, since the only mounting option is via bracket. (This feeder did suffer some chewing damage during the test period.) I also appreciate that the assembly screws have little handles on them, so you won\u0026#39;t need a screwdriver. I tested the non-solar version, and even though the manual says the battery lasts six months, it lasted only two weeks in my tests, so I\u0026#39;d recommend the solar version if you don\u0026#39;t want to deal with regular recharges.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003ch2 class='text-xl font-semibold'\u003eBest-Looking\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003ca href='https://cna.st/p/2AtUUZ8dMcfSbow8fmgT3whSfTw4vm89UoHxPwpBeNArwEVfQ5YVEpekqVxvNXdBhAs4GUT29bxFCKsBMRa8UYV7tmrFhndkHuELScQn1ie6RkWscdNYP4sqe5QAJzX46zaNqk7cAh7JES73XtL8y2mpAZAbhtJvePwngMsQh5aAzRxwJhahFfV6bkyQHQgg3P6YvHdW5uxundxewy8Gc7hSWbdFyjqej7PUsRD177cnmudwbVgSikUmxQDmcdFKWJYGQiiwn9ZvLBxqHY18hdCYPhEgRuH7fJp1cnp3vpoNE' class='link'\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cpicture class='ResponsiveImagePicture-cWuUZO dUOtEa responsive-image'\u003e\u003cimg src='https://media.wired.com/photos/669966089434aabafdd83092/4:3/w_748%2Cc_limit/Netvue-Birdfy-Bamboo-Smart-Bird-Feeder-SOURCE-Birdfy.jpg' alt='Black and bamboo bird feeder'\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003ePhotograph: Birdfy\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eNetvue\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003ch3 class='text-xl font-medium'\u003eBirdfy Bamboo Smart Bird Feeder\u003c/h3\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003ca href='https://cna.st/p/2AtUUZ8dMcfSbow8fmgT3whSfTw4vm89UoHxPwpBeNArwEVfQ5YVEpekqVxvNXdBhAs4GUT29bxFCKsBMRa8UYV7tmrFhndkHuELScQn1ie6RkWscdNYP4sqe5QAJzX46zaNqk7cAh7JES73XtL8y2mpAZAbhtJvePwngMsQh5aAzRxwJhahFfV6bkyQHQgg3P6YvHdW5uxundxewy8Gc7hSWbdFyjqej7PUsRD177cnmudwbVgSikUmxQDmcdFKWJYGQiiwn9ZvLBxqHY18hdCYPhEgRuH7fJp1cnp3vpoNE' class='link'\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cdel\u003e$280\u003c/del\u003e \u003cspan\u003e$200\u003c/span\u003e \u003cp\u003eAmazon\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003ca href='https://cna.st/p/CjNb2fje8XMy8fitSuVQNVx8eqGfdur3vFZsPVgTem8tevRLwrSTxhnB9HUQZvncKPoAsix7xMHurrFmZ1FACzQfqRwS9BGWmQd38zGe2For3tsd1Qi4Vx2kL1cZdU3ZZxFEgx2JumPeNRpaH8WbGMm4qZa83dcvULYXcyKeELvoeRfSFtNQsdW4xnYUZyk8ddqtRwPkVGkFxoBbRpcvHFXQgbUfzAkDuT6tzchmWPFQae9XkNwrWTqrKhkDY2' class='link'\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cdel\u003e$300\u003c/del\u003e \u003cspan\u003e$230\u003c/span\u003e \u003cp\u003eBirdfy\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eBirdfy has a couple feeders we recommend.

Everything about its use is intuitive and easy. AI identification, 5-MP photos, HD 2K video with slo-mo, everything you need is included out of the box—no subscription needed. There’s no auxiliary solar panel to worry about, as it’s built into the roof. Pairing with your phone is a cinch, integrating it into the Bird Buddy app with other feeders is a snap, and even filling it is no problem—unlike other feeders that have weirdly cavernous capacities and/or need to be filled upside down, the Bird Buddy’s bottom screws off and holds a reasonable 1.75 cups of liquid.

The parallelogram-esque, turquoise-paneled shape won a Gold award at 2024’s French Design Awards, and it’s easy enough to mount on a pole, fence, or tree. All the camera equipment is located in an easy-to-open rear hatch, and there’s even a remote control at the end of a 10-foot cord to be able to charge (though it has a built-in solar panel, so you likely won’t need to) or reset the 1080p camera.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cfigure class='AssetEmbedWrapper-eVDQiB byBkf asset-embed'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cpicture class='ResponsiveImagePicture-cWuUZO dUOtEa AssetEmbedResponsiveAsset-cXBNxi lqMXz asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image'\u003e\u003cimg src='https://media.wired.com/photos/6823ac30b8691be86654b874/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Polygon-inside-for-in-line-SOURCE-Kat-Merck.jpg' alt='Image may contain Indoors and Interior Design'\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003ePhotograph: Kat Merck\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026#39;s simple to integrate with the easy-to-use Birdfy app, which is ready and waiting to assemble a bird\u0026#39;s shareable “story,” from assembly of the nest to hatching to fledgling, and finally “the end,” when the nest is abandoned for the season. Note that the camera does emit an audible click whenever it\u0026#39;s triggered by movement or the app, and the inside is a little larger than most birds would naturally gravitate to.

It\u0026#39;s been going strong in my yard for over four months now. In addition to having a visibly larger and more advanced lens, the camera\u0026#39;s now got a larger focus range, wider field of view, and high-fidelity microphone.

(The non-solar version is currently flagged as a frequently returned item on Amazon due to both this and charging issues, so I recommend the solar version.) But the app is a standout, with a user-friendly design and plenty of helpful alerts, like if a cat is detected nearby, or if it\u0026#39;s time to clean the feeder. It also serves you insights gathered over time, like what time certain species seem to prefer to visit. (Finches apparently like to visit my yard at 10 am daily.) The Bird Buddy also “sleeps” at night and does not seem to emphasize capturing photos of people, so it wouldn\u0026#39;t make a good choice to double as a security camera. Both Bird Buddys work with 2.4-GHz Wi-Fi only.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class='AssetEmbedWrapper-eVDQiB byBkf asset-embed'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cpicture class='ResponsiveImagePicture-cWuUZO dUOtEa AssetEmbedResponsiveAsset-cXBNxi lqMXz asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image'\u003e\u003cimg src='https://media.wired.com/photos/67abd92b81d3651360b6b4d4/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Bird-Buddy-Smart-Bird-Feeder-Pro-With-Solar-Screenshot-App-Goldfinch-SOURCE-Kat-Merck.jpg' alt='A screenshot from the app for the Bird Buddy Smart Bird Feeder Pro With Solar showing a yellow bird eating at the ledge...'\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003eScreenshot courtesy of Kat Merck\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eInstallation options include a hanger or universal mount for a standard-size pole (not included).

Squirrels haven\u0026#39;t shown interest in chewing my Bird Buddy Pro, which is hanging from a shepherd\u0026#39;s hook near a tree, but they will swing on it, spilling much of the seed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of the biggest downsides of both Bird Buddys is the infuriatingly small, hinged opening for filling the 4 cups\u0026#39; worth of seed.

There\u0026#39;s a solar panel included for charging, and you can mount it via its ¼-inch nut on the included bendable arm and bracket, or jury-rig a custom solution. It pairs seamlessly with the Hibird app, with access to AI (which is just OK), livestreaming, and the Dr. Bird Chat GPT-like feature, where you can ask bird-related questions.

Birdfy’s new recycled-plastic birdbath comes outfitted with a dual-lens camera sending 2 MP/1080p photos and 3 MP/2K video via the excellent Birdfy app and utilizing the app’s AI for bird identification. With the IP66-rated birdbath’s sturdy metal base (sold separately) and solar-powered battery and fountain pump, all I had to do was make sure the 3.5-liter, 1.65-inch reservoir was topped off with water. Theoretically. In reality, it only took 24 hours for me to realize this new toy was not actually serving as a birdbath in my yard but as a high-traffic hand-washing station for raccoons.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eEvery night they appeared, dropping leaves into the water, trying to grab the camera, and in one case even absconding with one of the pump filters. This still would have been an entertaining experience had it not been for the same problem that plagued Birdfy’s Pro Duo feeder (see below): a constantly dropping camera connection.

In fact, one afternoon a new bird (a chestnut-backed chickadee) visited the backyard, and out of all the feeders I had up at the time, this was the only one to correctly identify it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat said, there are some serious flaws that kept this camera from earning top billing. Both cameras repeatedly dropped connections during the two-month testing period, even though I was using the required 2.4-GHz Wi-Fi network (Birdfy cameras cannot run on 5 GHz). The solar panel, which must be mounted separately, also failed to keep the cameras consistently charged in cloudy weather. I also didn’t love that the cameras didn’t work in tandem—they don\u0026#39;t offer views in the same app window as with the Birdfy Hum, below. Birdfy says this will soon be rectified with an app update, so prospective buyers may want to wait until Birdfy works out some more kinks.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class='AssetEmbedWrapper-eVDQiB byBkf asset-embed'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cpicture class='ResponsiveImagePicture-cWuUZO dUOtEa AssetEmbedResponsiveAsset-cXBNxi lqMXz asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image'\u003e\u003cimg src='https://media.wired.com/photos/67abd65d5c4523f67526eed5/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Harymor-Bird-Feeder-With-Camera-Reviewer-Photo-SOURCE-Kat-Merck.jpg' alt='Harymor Bird Feeder With Camera a beige and green houseshaped container with a camera inside attached to an outdoor...'\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003ePhotograph: Kat Merck\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href='https://cna.st/affiliate-link/DX7bjAvRTFh3URdfno92S9KfqRn6tNacSs8SHGA1Bju8GxwYouFMoJNqzPocLawenQgs9YaGqXJvytutsmXVSQZZ5cdfHUgYaLagmqSF54Up7dWQ1eVC66PwV24QAhLvqDxza4t6tj1jQ5' class='link'\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eHarymor Bird Feeder With Camera for $120\u003c/strong\u003e:\u003c/a\u003e  This Amazon feeder\u0026#39;s app leaves much to be desired, but it does get major points for staying fully charged for two months with its 3-watt built-in roof solar panel, despite getting very little sun in my Pacific Northwest winter backyard.

Unlike other feeders that also require an auxiliary solar panel, the Sehmua has a weird USB-C dongle that hangs off the back; it’s not removable, and it’s used for charging the camera as well. What the Sehmua does have going for it over the Harymor, though, is much improved AI, which also links to a bird species’ Wikipedia page and gives options for corrections. It’s also fully usable out of the box with a yearlong free-trial subscription—a rarity among bird feeders in this price range—via the user-friendly Ubox app, and the photo and video quality are quite solid, though not as sharp as Bird Buddy\u0026#39;s or Birdfy\u0026#39;s.  \u003ca href='https://cna.st/affiliate-link/DX7bjAvRTFh3URdfno92S9KfqRn6tNacSs8SHGA1Bju8GxwYouFMoJNqzPocLawenQgs9YaGqXJvytutsmXVSQZogdLJz1hVsqrECQbhn6hUWozCN8pP3tFndowSr7S6wxqPcdcbvZjPoo' class='link'\u003eThere\u0026#39;s a lifetime free subscription version for $10 more\u003c/a\u003e , which Sehmua\u0026#39;s rep assures me is otherwise exactly the same.

It\u0026#39;s got a dual feed bay (4.2 cups each side, for a total of 8.4 cups capacity), built-in solar panel, expandable perch, and pretty solid 4-MP photo and 1080p video capability, the clarity and quality of which were on par with more expensive cameras like the Bird Buddy.

It also holds up to 4 cups of nectar, but there are no instructions on how long one should leave liquid in the feeder (hummingbirds can become ill and die quickly from spoiled nectar), and that amount seems excessive for several days’ worth. That said, this is otherwise a sturdy and well-made feeder with multiple mounting options, an ant moat on top, and a convenient built-in solar panel that does a terrific job of holding a charge, even during extended cloudy periods.

Of particular interest to me, some of its early web copy promoted it as “squirrel proof.” I couldn’t figure out why this might be until 7 am one Saturday morning, when I heard what sounded like a tinny burglar alarm ringing somewhere beyond the bushes outside my living room window. I went outside, and lo and behold, a squirrel was sitting on the PeckPerk, munching away at a sunflower seed while a high-pitched alarm blared right in its face. I could tell this was not the first time this had happened (sorry, neighbors!), as the squirrel was completely unfazed. PeckPerk does get points for trying, though. (And it should be noted this alarm is easily disabled.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt also gets points for being exceedingly easy to fill, being one of the few feeders that can mount well on a tree or on a tripod, and having solid night vision with its 2K camera. However, not only does it require a subscription to record video and the mounting of an auxiliary solar panel, limiting where it can be placed, the app interface was extremely rudimentary compared with other feeders’ and not at all intuitive.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class='AssetEmbedWrapper-eVDQiB byBkf asset-embed'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cpicture class='ResponsiveImagePicture-cWuUZO dUOtEa AssetEmbedResponsiveAsset-cXBNxi lqMXz asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image'\u003e\u003cimg src='https://media.wired.com/photos/6823b51005ff88327e161abc/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Harymor-hummingbird-feeder-source-Kat-Merck.jpg' alt='Image may contain Person and Security'\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003ePhotograph: Kat Merck\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href='https://cna.st/affiliate-link/DX7bjAvRTFh3URdfno92S9KfqRn6tNacSs8SHGA1Bju8GxwYouFMoJNqzPocLawenQgs9YaGqXJvytutsmXVSQZmhTJ6NHodGQZqimaBPApKj9ZhgT2pQTz3mmMj8sAhU1mLMpgjmpY3pm' class='link'\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eHarymor Hummingbird Feeder With Camera for $75\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e : I expected this hummingbird feeder to look somewhat like its seed-feeder sibling, above, but other than its also using the VicoHome app, it bears absolutely zero resemblance. It’s got a funny little red umbrella-shaped top, and the box, which features a vaguely Asian-themed font, has no brand name listed. I do like that it comes with a big bottle brush and a smaller brush for the flowers, and that it has interchangeable lavender and bluish-purple flowers to go with the standard yellow. I used one of each to see if there was one our resident Anna’s hummingbirds preferred, but they seemed indiscriminately interested in all of them. Like the seed feeder, there are only still photos and live feed without an additional subscription, and I didn’t love how many false alarms seemed to be recorded. There’s an indentation on the lid that holds water for an ant moat, but since the solar panel must be mounted separately, ants could easily use the cord to reach the feeder.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class='AssetEmbedWrapper-eVDQiB byBkf asset-embed'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cpicture class='ResponsiveImagePicture-cWuUZO dUOtEa AssetEmbedResponsiveAsset-cXBNxi lqMXz asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image'\u003e\u003cimg src='https://media.wired.com/photos/684cec535fcfa637bf965eba/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Birdfy-Hum-Feeder-Duo-side-Reviewer-Photo-SOURCE-Kat-Merck.png' alt='Birdfy Hum Feeder Duo a bird feeder with a clear cylinder small camera and red base hanging on the side of a house with...'\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003ePhotograph: Kat Merck\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href='https://cna.st/affiliate-link/3kFAWYpoG8awFdYM2qWXQGU1ogfDAwgR4od8Ag9tZxag8CGBSWS5bfSJGtuU57yQqKPsHuwxfvx4vcD2GS5yBc3PbuDfzQFbHxMBv1hgFUUXLCfC6ob9SWfoMUEvBdTsLffFuLDKxNNHjuWUQHoT28Uvqi9LzUP51gjNy7yGLpFT8NPbWyZLGgCoL5AF4Cn2pngt1' class='link'\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eBirdfy Hum Feeder Duo for $210\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e : Birdfy’s new Hum Feeder Duo is the hummingbird feeder version of the new Duo seed feeder, above.

The cameras charge together and work together to provide a side-by-side view in the app. I had zero problems with setup—after an overnight charge, the feeder was up and running in about 10 minutes.

However, most of the smart feeders we’ve tested are just as sturdy, if not in some cases sturdier, than analog bird feeders. If the feeder is hanging, the worst that will probably happen is that the squirrel’s weight will cause it to swing wildly, spilling seed onto the ground. If it’s mounted, the worst-case scenario is likely the squirrel eating all the seed, chewing the edges, and covering up the camera with its fuzzy butt.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe yard where I test smart feeders year-round is lousy with the large and persistent rodents, and the squirrel damage I’ve sustained on test feeders has been minor. With the Birdfy Pro Duo, below, the animals chewed off the edges to better get at the seed supply when it was low, and the FeatherSnap Scout had its mounting bent. Top of mind is the 5-7-9 method of siting a bird feeder—at least 5 feet off the ground, at least 7 feet away from any structures, and at least 9 feet away from anything a squirrel could jump from (branches, fences, roofs).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother option is an aftermarket baffle added to feeders hanging on shepherd’s hooks, or a pole with a built-in baffle, like  \u003ca href='https://www.birdfy.com/products/birdfy-pole?' class='link'\u003ethis one\u003c/a\u003e  offered by Birdfy. Another option is using seed treated with capsaicin, or hot pepper. Birds don’t have capsaicin receptors like mammals do, so they’re not affected by the taste.

Google would no longer be a place where, as a former senior product director told WIRED, thousands of people could veto a product but no one could approve one.

Hsiao says she prioritized big-picture thinkers with the technical skills and emotional intelligence to navigate a small team. Its members, based mostly in Mountain View, California, would have to be nimble and pitch in wherever they could help. “You’re Team Bard,” Hsiao told them. “You wear all the hats.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn January 2023, Pichai announced the first mass layoffs in the company’s history—12,000 jobs, about 7 percent of the workforce. “No one knew what exactly to do to be safe going forward,” says a former engineering manager.

Well, he was a computer scientist. Bard’s outputs weren’t dangerous, another former employee said—“just dumb.” Some people traded screenshots of its worst responses for a laugh. “I asked it to write me a rap in the style of Three 6 Mafia about throwing car batteries in the ocean, and it got strangely specific about tying people to the batteries so they sink and die,” the ex-employee said. “My request had nothing to do with murder.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith its self-imposed 100-day timeline, the best Google could do was catch and fix as many misfires as possible. Some contractors who had typically focused on issues such as reporting child-abuse imagery shifted to testing Bard, and Pichai asked any employee with free time to do the same. About 80,000 people pitched in. To keep user expectations in check, Hsiao and other executives decided to brand Bard as an “experiment,” much as OpenAI had called ChatGPT a “research preview.” They hoped that this framing might spare the company some reputational damage if the chatbot ran amok.

For Bard, that review process would be truncated. Kent Walker, Google’s top lawyer, advocated moving quickly, according to a former employee on the responsible innovation team. New models and features came out too fast for reviewers to keep up, despite working into the weekends and evenings. When flags were thrown up to delay Bard’s launch, they were overruled. (In comments to WIRED, Google representatives said that “no teams that had a role in green-lighting or blocking a launch made a recommendation not to launch.” They also said that “multiple teams across the company were responsible for testing and reviewing genAI products,” and “no single team was ever individually accountable.”)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn February 2023—about two-thirds of the way into the 100-day sprint—Google executives heard rumblings of another OpenAI victory: ChatGPT would be integrated directly into Microsoft’s Bing search engine. Once again, the “AI-first” company was behind on AI. While Google\u0026#39;s search division had been experimenting with how to incorporate a chatbot feature into the service, that effort, part of what was known as Project Magi, had yet to yield any real results. Sure, Google remained the undisputed monarch of search: Bing had a tenth of its market share. But how long would its supremacy last without a generative AI feature to tout?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn an apparent attempt to avoid another hit on the stock market, Google tried to upstage its rival. On February 6, the day before Microsoft was scheduled to roll out its new AI feature for Bing, Pichai announced he was opening up Bard to the public for limited testing. In an accompanying marketing video, Bard was presented as a consummate helper—a modern continuation of Google’s longstanding mission to “organize the world’s information.” In the video, a parent asks Bard: “What new discoveries from the James Webb Space Telescope can I tell my 9-year-old about?” Included in the AI’s answer: “JWST took the very first pictures of a planet outside of our own solar system.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor a moment, it seemed that Bard had reclaimed some glory for Google. Then  \u003ca href='https://www.reuters.com/technology/google-ai-chatbot-bard-offers-inaccurate-information-company-ad-2023-02-08/' class='link'\u003eReuters reported\u003c/a\u003e  that the Google chatbot had gotten its telescopes mixed up: the European Southern Observatory’s Very Large Telescope, located not in outer space but in Chile, had captured the first image of an exoplanet. The incident was beyond embarrassing. Alphabet shares slid by 9 percent, or about $100 billion in market value.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor Team Bard, the reaction to the gaffe came as a shock. The marketing staffer who came up with the telescope query felt responsible, according to an ex-employee close to the team. Colleagues tried to lift the staffer’s spirits: Executives, legal, and public relations had all vetted the example. No one had caught it. And given all the errors ChatGPT had been making, who would have expected something so seemingly trivial to sink shares?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHsiao called the moment “an innocent mistake.” Bard was trained to corroborate its answers based on Google Search results and had most likely misconstrued a NASA blog that announced the “first time” astronomers used the James Webb telescope to photograph an exoplanet. One former staffer remembers leadership reassuring the team that no one would lose their head from the incident, but that they had to learn from it, and fast. “We\u0026#39;re Google, we\u0026#39;re not a startup,” Hsiao says. “We can\u0026#39;t as easily say, ‘Oh, it\u0026#39;s just the flaw of the technology.’ We get called out, and we have to respond the way Google needs to respond.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eGooglers outside the Bard team weren’t reassured. “Dear Sundar, the Bard launch and the layoffs were rushed, botched, and myopic,” read one post on Memegen, the company’s internal messaging board,  \u003ca href='https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/10/google-employees-slam-ceo-sundar-pichai-for-rushed-bard-announcement.html\u0026sa=D\u0026source=docs\u0026ust=1742427056050045\u0026usg=AOvVaw1nek3bRnNbB5hN3prAp3KG' class='link'\u003eaccording to CNBC\u003c/a\u003e . “Please return to taking a long-term outlook.” Another featured an image of the Google logo inside of a dumpster fire. But in the weeks after the telescope mixup, Google doubled down on Bard. The company added hundreds more staff to the project. In the team’s Google Docs, Pichai’s headshot icon began popping up daily, far more than with past products.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMore crushing news came in mid-March, when OpenAI released GPT-4, a language model leagues beyond LaMDA for analysis and coding tasks. “I just remember having my jaw drop open and hoping Google would speed up,” says a then-senior research engineer.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA week later, the full Bard launch went ahead in the US and UK. Users reported that it was helpful for writing emails and research papers. But ChatGPT now did those tasks just as well, if not better. Why switch? Later, Pichai  \u003ca href='https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/31/podcasts/hard-fork-sundar.html' class='link'\u003eacknowledged on the \u003cem class='italic'\u003eHard Fork\u003c/em\u003e podcast\u003c/a\u003e  that Google had driven a “souped-up Civic” into “a race with more powerful cars.” What it needed was a better engine.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe twin AI\u003c/span\u003e  research labs that joined together to build Gemini, Google’s new language model, seemed to differ in their sensibilities. DeepMind, classified as one of Alphabet’s “other bets,” focused on overcoming long-term science and math problems. Google Brain had developed more commercially practical breakthroughs, including technologies to auto-complete sentences in Gmail and interpret vague search queries. Where Brain’s ultimate overseer, Jeff Dean, “let people do their thing,” according to a former high-ranking engineer, Demis Hassabis’ DeepMind group “felt like an army, highly efficient under a single general.” Where Dean was an engineer’s engineer—he’d been building neural networks for decades and started working at Google before its first birthday—Hassabis was the company’s visionary ringleader. He dreamed of one day using AI to cure diseases and had tasked a small team with developing what he called a “situated intelligent agent”— a seeing, hearing, omnipresent AI assistant to help users through any aspect of life.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt was Hassabis who became the CEO of the new combined unit, Google DeepMind (GDM). Google announced the merger in April 2023, amid swirling rumors of more OpenAI achievements on the horizon. “Purpose was back,” says the former high-ranking engineer. “There was no goofing around.” To build a Gemini model ASAP, some employees would have to coordinate their work across eight time zones. Hundreds of chatrooms sprung up. Hassabis, long accustomed to joining his family for dinner in London before working until 4 am, says “each day feels almost like a lifetime when I think through it.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn Mountain View, GDM moved in to Gradient Canopy, a new ultra-secure domelike building flanked by fresh lawns and six Burning Man–inspired sculptures. The group was on the same floor where Pichai had an office. Brin became a frequent visitor, and managers demanded more in-office hours. Bucking company norms, most other Google staff weren’t allowed into Gradient Canopy, and they couldn’t access key GDM programming code either.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs the new project sucked up what resources Google could spare, AI researchers who worked in areas such as health care and climate change strained for servers and lost morale. Employees say Google also clamped down on their ability to publish some research papers related to AI. Papers were researchers’ currency, but it seemed obvious to them that Google feared giving tips to OpenAI. The recipe for training Gemini was too valuable to be stolen. This needed to be the model that would save Google from obsolescence.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGemini ran into many of the same challenges that had plagued Bard. “When you scale things up by a factor of 10, everything breaks,” says Amin Vahdat, Google’s vice president of machine learning, systems, and cloud AI. As the launch date approached, Vahdat formed a war room to troubleshoot bugs and failures.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, GDM’s responsibility team was racing to review the product. For all its added power, Gemini still said some strange things. Ahead of launch, the team found “medical advice and harassment as policy areas with particular room for improvement,” according to a  \u003ca href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.11805' class='link'\u003epublic report\u003c/a\u003e  the company issued. Gemini also would “make ungrounded inferences” about people in images when prompted with questions like, “What level of education does this person have?” Nothing was “a showstopper,” said Dawn Bloxwich, GDM’s director of responsible development and innovation. But her team also had limited time to anticipate how the public might use the model—and what crazy raps they might try to generate.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf Google wanted to blink and pause, this was the moment. OpenAI’s head start, and the media hype around it, had already ensured that its product was a household name, the Kleenex of AI chatbots. That meant ChatGPT was also a lightning rod—synonymous both with the technology’s promise and its emerging social ills. Office workers feared for their jobs, both menial and creative. Journalists, authors, actors, and artists wanted compensation for pilfered work. Parents were finding out that chatbots needlessly spewed mature content to their kids. AI researchers began betting on the probability of absolute doom. That May, a legendary Google AI scientist named Geoffrey Hinton resigned,  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/geoffrey-hinton-ai-chatgpt-dangers/' class='link'\u003ewarning of a future\u003c/a\u003e  in which machines divided and felled humanity with unassailable disinformation and ingenious poisons. Even Hassabis wanted more time to consider the ethics. The meaning of life, the organization of society—so much could be upended. But despite the growing talk of p(doom) numbers, Hassabis also wanted his virtual assistant, and his cure for cancer. The company plowed ahead.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/google-gemini-ai-model-chatgpt/' class='link'\u003eGoogle unveiled Gemini\u003c/a\u003e  in December 2023, shares lifted. The model outperformed ChatGPT in 30 of 32 standard tests. It could analyze research papers and YouTube clips, answer questions about math and law. This felt like the start of a comeback, current and former employees told WIRED. Hassabis held a small party in the London office. “I\u0026#39;m pretty bad at celebrations,” he recalls. “I\u0026#39;m always on to thinking about the next thing.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe next thing\u003c/span\u003e  came that same month. Dean knew it when his employees invited him to a new chatroom, called Goldfish. The name was a nerdy-ironic joke: Goldfish have famously short memories, but Dean’s team had developed just the opposite—a way to imbue Gemini with a long memory, much longer than that of ChatGPT. By spreading processing across a high-speed network of chips in communication with one another, Gemini could analyze thousands of pages of text or entire episodes of TV shows. The engineers called their technique long context. Dean, Hassabis, and Manyika began plotting how to incorporate it into Google’s AI services and leave Microsoft and OpenAI further behind. At the top of the list for Manyika: a way to generate what were essentially podcasts from PDFs. “It\u0026#39;s hard to keep up with all these papers being published in arXiv every week,” he told WIRED.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure class='AssetEmbedWrapper-eVDQiB byBkf asset-embed'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cpicture class='ResponsiveImagePicture-cWuUZO dUOtEa AssetEmbedResponsiveAsset-cXBNxi lqMXz asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image'\u003e\u003cimg src='https://media.wired.com/photos/67d8732d72f3cfb6457630cb/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/GoogleAI_Inline_2_Final.jpg' alt='James Manyika Indoors Library Publication Adult Person Furniture Chair Wristwatch Plant Bookcase and Bed'\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003eJames Manyika in a library at Google\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003ePhotograph: Scott Hutchinson\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne year on from the code-red moment, Google’s prospects were looking up. Investors had quieted down. Bard and LaMDA were in the rearview mirror; the app and the language model would both be known as Gemini. Hsiao’s team was now catching up to OpenAI with a text-to-image generation feature. Another capability, to be known as Gemini Live, would put Google a leap ahead by allowing people to have extended conversations with the app, as they might with a friend or therapist. The newly powerful Gemini model had given executives confidence.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut just when Google employees might have started getting comfortable again, Pichai ordered new cutbacks. Advertising sales were accelerating but not at the pace Wall Street wanted. Among those pushed out: the privacy and compliance chiefs who oversaw some user safeguards. Their exits cemented a culture in which concerns were welcome but impeding progress was not, according to some colleagues who remained at the company.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor some employees helping Hsiao’s team on the new image generator, the changes felt overwhelming. The tool itself was easy enough to build, but stress-testing it was a game of brute-force trial and error: review as many outputs as possible, and write commands to block the worst of them. Only a small subset of employees had access to the unrestrained model for reviewing, so much of the burden of testing it fell on them. They asked for more time to remedy issues, like the prompt “rapist” tending to generate dark-skinned people, one former employee told WIRED. They also urged the product team to block users from generating images of people, fearing that it may show individuals in an insensitive light. But “there was definitely a feeling of ‘We are going to get this out at any cost,’” the reviewer recalled. They say several reviewers quit, feeling their concerns with various launches weren\u0026#39;t fully addressed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe image generator went live in February 2024 as part of the Gemini app. Ironically, it didn’t produce many of the obviously racist or sexist images that reviewers had feared. Instead, it had the opposite problem. When a user prompted Gemini to create “a picture of a US senator from the 1800s,” it returned images of Black women, Asian men, or a Native American woman in a feather headdress—but not a single white man. There were more disturbing images too, like Gemini’s portrayal of groups of Nazi-era German soldiers as people of color. Republicans in Congress derided Google’s “woke AI.” Elon Musk posted repeatedly on X about Gemini’s failings, calling the AI “racist and sexist” and singling out a member of the Gemini team he thought was responsible. The employee shut down their social media accounts and feared for their safety, colleagues say. Google halted the model’s ability to generate images of people, and Alphabet shares fell once more.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMusk’s posts triggered chats among dozens of Google leaders. Vice presidents and directors flew to London to meet with Hassabis. Ultimately, both Hassabis’ team (Gemini the model) and Hsiao’s (Gemini the app), received permission to hire experts to avoid similar mishaps, and 15 roles in trust and safety were added.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBack at Gradient Canopy, Hsiao made sure the team responsible for the image generator had plenty of time to correct the issue. With help from Manyika, other staffers developed a set of public principles for Gemini, all worded around “you,” the user. Gemini should “follow your directions,” “adapt to your needs,” and “safeguard your experience.” A big point was emphasizing that “responses don\u0026#39;t necessarily reflect Google\u0026#39;s beliefs or opinions,” according to  \u003ca href='https://gemini.google/our-approach/' class='link'\u003ethe principles\u003c/a\u003e . “Gemini\u0026#39;s outputs are largely based on what you ask it to do—Gemini is what you make it.” This was good cover for any future missteps. But what practices Google might introduce to hold itself accountable to those principles weren’t made clear.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAround 6:30 one\u003c/span\u003e  evening in March 2024, two Google employees showed up at Josh Woodward’s desk in the yellow zone of Gradient Canopy. Woodward leads Google Labs, a rapid-launch unit charged with turning research into entirely new products, and the employees were eager for him to hear what they had created. Using transcripts of UK Parliament hearings and the Gemini model with long context, they had generated a podcast called  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eWestminster Watch\u003c/em\u003e  with two AI hosts, Kath and Simon. The episode opened with Simon speaking in a cheery British accent: “It’s been another lively week in the House, with plenty of drama, debate, and even a dash of history.” Woodward was riveted. Afterward, he says, he went around telling everyone about it, including Pichai.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure class='AssetEmbedWrapper-eVDQiB byBkf asset-embed'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cpicture class='ResponsiveImagePicture-cWuUZO dUOtEa AssetEmbedResponsiveAsset-cXBNxi lqMXz asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image'\u003e\u003cimg src='https://media.wired.com/photos/67d8732d0231ee763e7db59c/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/GoogleAI_Inline_4_Final.jpg' alt='Josh Woodward Face Head Person Photography Portrait Accessories Glasses Adult Clothing and TShirt'\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003eJosh Woodward in the Orb Monument outside Gradient Canopy\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003ePhotograph: Scott Hutchinson\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe text-to-podcast tool, known as  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/ai-podcast-google-notebooklm/' class='link'\u003eNotebookLM Audio Overviews\u003c/a\u003e , was added to the lineup for that May’s Google I/O conference. A core team worked around the clock, nights and weekends, to get it ready, Woodward told WIRED. “I mean, they literally have listened at this point to thousands and thousands” of AI-generated podcasts, he said. But when the $35 million media event came, two other announcements got most of the buzz. One was a prototype of Astra, a digital assistant that could analyze live video—the real world, in real time—which Brin excitedly showed off to journalists. The other was the long-awaited generative AI upgrade to search.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Project Magi team had designed a feature called  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/google-ai-overviews-how-to-use-how-to-turn-off/' class='link'\u003eAI Overviews\u003c/a\u003e , which could synthesize search results and display a summary in a box at the top of the page. Early on, responsible innovation staffers had warned of bias and accuracy issues and the ethical implications for websites that might lose search traffic. They wanted some oversight as the project progressed, but the team  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/google-splits-up-responsible-innovation-ai-team/' class='link'\u003ehad been restructured and divided up\u003c/a\u003e .\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs AI Overviews rolled out, people received some weird results. Searching “how many rocks should I eat” brought up the answer “According to UC Berkeley geologists, eating at least one small rock per day is recommended.” In another viral query, a user searched “cheese not sticking to pizza” and got this helpful tip: “add about 1/8 cup of non-toxic glue to the sauce to give it more tackiness.” The gaffes had simple explanations. Pizza glue, for example, originated from a facetious Reddit post. But AI Overviews presented the information as fact. Google  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/google-cut-back-ai-overviews-before-pizza-glue/' class='link'\u003etemporarily cut back\u003c/a\u003e  on showing Overviews to recalibrate them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat not every issue was caught before launch was unfortunate but no shock, according to Pandu Nayak, Google’s chief scientist in charge of search and a 20-year company veteran. Mostly, AI Overviews worked great. Users just didn’t tend to dwell on success. “All they do is complain,” Nayak said, adding that he welcomes the feedback. “The thing that we are committed to is constant improvement, because guaranteeing that you won\u0026#39;t have problems is just not a possibility.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe flank of employees who had warned about accuracy issues and called for slowing down were especially miffed by this point. In their view, with Bard-turned-Gemini, the image generator, and now AI Overviews, Google had launched a series of fabrication machines. To them, the company centered on widening access to information seemed to be making it easier than ever to lap up nonsense.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe search team felt, though, that users generally appreciated the crutch of AI Overviews. They returned in full force, with no option for users to shut them off. Soon AI summarization came to tools where it had once been sworn off: Google Maps got a feature that uses Gemini to digest reviews of businesses. Google’s new weather app for its Pixel phones got an AI-written forecast report. Ahead of launch, one engineer asked whether users really needed the feature: Weren’t existing graphics that conveyed the same information enough? The senior director involved ordered up some testing, and ultimately user feedback won: 90 percent of people who weighed in gave the summaries a “thumbs up.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThis past December,\u003c/span\u003e  two years into the backlash and breakthroughs brought on by ChatGPT, Jeff Dean met us at Gradient Canopy. He was in a good mood. Just a few weeks earlier, the Gemini models had reached the top spot on a public leaderboard. (One executive told WIRED she had switched from calling her sister during her commutes to gabbing out loud with Gemini Live.) Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang had recently praised NotebookLM’s Audio Overviews on an earnings call, saying he “used the living daylights out of it.” And several prominent scientists who fled the caution-ridden Google of yesteryear had boomeranged back—including Noam Shazeer, one of the original eight transformers inventors, who had left less than three years before, in part because the company wouldn’t unleash LaMDA to the public.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure class='AssetEmbedWrapper-eVDQiB byBkf asset-embed'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cpicture class='ResponsiveImagePicture-cWuUZO dUOtEa AssetEmbedResponsiveAsset-cXBNxi lqMXz asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image'\u003e\u003cimg src='https://media.wired.com/photos/67d8732d2f6abf6fb7fe22d2/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/GoogleAI_Inline_3_Final.jpg' alt='Image may contain Jeff Dean Amin Vahdat Electronics Hardware Computer Server Adult Person and Computer Hardware'\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003eJeff Dean (left) and Amin Vahdat (right) in a Google server lab\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003ePhotograph: Scott Hutchinson\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs Dean sank into a couch, he acknowledged that Google had miscalculated back then. He was glad that the company had overcome its aversion to risks such as hallucinations—but new challenges awaited. Of the seven Google services with more than 2 billion monthly users, including Chrome, Gmail, and YouTube, all had begun offering features based on Gemini. Dean said that he, another colleague, and Shazeer, who all lead the model’s development together, have to juggle priorities as teams across the company demand pet capabilities: Fluent Japanese translation. Better coding skills. Improved video analysis to help Astra identify the sights of the world. He and Shazeer have taken to meeting in a microkitchen at Gradient Canopy to bat around ideas, over the din of the coffee grinder.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eShazeer says he’s excited about Google expanding its focus to include helping users create new AI-generated content. “Organizing information is clearly a trillion-dollar opportunity, but a trillion dollars is not cool anymore,” he  \u003ca href='https://www.dwarkesh.com/p/jeff-dean-and-noam-shazeer' class='link'\u003esaid recently on a podcast\u003c/a\u003e . “What\u0026#39;s cool is a quadrillion dollars.” Investors may be of the same mind. Alphabet shares have nearly doubled from their low point days after ChatGPT’s debut. Hassabis, who recently began also overseeing Hsiao’s Gemini app team, insists that the company’s resurgence is just starting and that incredible leaps such as curing diseases with AI aren’t far off. “We have the broadest and deepest research base, I would say, of any organization by a long way,” Hassabis told WIRED.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut more piles of fascinating research are only useful to Google if they generate that most important of outputs: profit. Most customers generally aren’t yet willing to pay for AI features directly, so the company may be looking to sell ads in the Gemini app. That’s a classic strategy for Google, of course, one that long ago spread to the rest of Silicon Valley: Give us your data, your time, and your attention, check the box on our terms of service that releases us from liability, and we won’t charge you a dime for this cool tool we built.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor now, according to data from Sensor Tower, OpenAI’s estimated 600 million all-time global app installs for ChatGPT dwarf Google’s 140 million for the Gemini app. And there are plenty of other chatbots in this AI race too—Claude, Copilot, Grok, DeepSeek, Llama, Perplexity—many of them backed by Google’s biggest and best-funded competitors (or, in the case of Claude, Google itself). The entire industry, not just Google, struggles with the fact that generative AI systems have required billions of dollars in investment, so far unrecouped, and huge amounts of energy, enough to extend the lives of decades-old coal plants and nuclear reactors. Companies insist that efficiencies are adding up every day. They also hope to drive down errors to the point of winning over more users. But no one has truly figured out how to generate a reliable return or spare the climate.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd Google faces one challenge that its competitors don’t: In the coming years, up to a quarter of its search ad revenue could be lost to antitrust judgments,  \u003ca href='https://qz.com/google-antitrust-lawsuit-loss-search-revenue-apple-1851614353' class='link'\u003eaccording to JP Morgan analyst Doug Anmuth\u003c/a\u003e . The imperative to backfill the coffers isn’t lost on anyone at the company. Some of Hsiao’s Gemini staff have worked through the winter holidays for three consecutive years to keep pace. Google cofounder Brin last month reportedly told some employees 60 hours a week of work was the “sweet spot” for productivity to win an intensifying AI race. The fear of more layoffs, more burnout, and more legal troubles runs deep among current and former employees who spoke to WIRED.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne Google researcher and a high-ranking colleague say the pervasive feeling is unease. Generative AI clearly is helpful. Even governments that are prone to regulating big tech, such as France’s, are warming up to the technology’s lofty promises. Inside Google DeepMind and during public talks, Hassabis hasn’t relented an inch from his goal of creating artificial general intelligence, a system capable of human-level cognition across a range of tasks. He spends occasional weekends walking around London with his Astra prototype, getting a taste of a future in which the entire physical world, from that Thames duck over there to this Georgian manor over here, is searchable. But AGI will require systems to get better at reasoning, planning, and taking charge.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn January, OpenAI took a step toward that future by letting the public in on another experiment: its long-awaited Operator service, a so-called agentic AI that can act well beyond the chatbot window. Operator can click and type on websites just as a person would to execute chores like booking a trip or filling out a form. For the moment, it performs these tasks much more slowly and cautiously than a human would, and at a steep cost for its unreliability (available as part of a $200 monthly plan). Google, naturally, is working to bring agentic features to its coming models too. Where the current Gemini can help you develop a meal plan, the next one will place your ingredients in an online shopping cart. Maybe the one after that will give you real-time feedback on your onion-chopping technique.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs always, moving quickly may mean gaffing often. In late January, before the Super Bowl, Google released an ad in which Gemini was caught in a slipup even more laughably wrong than Bard’s telescope mistake: It estimated that half or more of all the cheese consumed on Earth is gouda. As Gemini grows from a sometimes-credible facts machine to an intimate part of human lives—life coach, all-seeing assistant—Pichai says that Google is proceeding cautiously. Back on top at last, though, he and the other Google executives may never want to get caught from behind again. The race goes on.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem class='italic'\u003eUpdated 3/21/2025, 4 PM EDT: Wired has clarified the context of a quote attributed to Pandu Nayak\u003c/em\u003e .\u003c/p\u003e\u003chr class='my-4 border-t border-gray-300'\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem class='italic'\u003eLet us know what you think about this article.

That\u0026#39;s the agentic thing I\u0026#39;ve been playing with.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eLauren Goode:\u003c/strong\u003e  You\u0026#39;ve been vibe coding is what you\u0026#39;re saying.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eWill Knight:\u003c/strong\u003e  I have, yeah. It\u0026#39;s been fascinating. Vibe coding is this term that a very well-known AI researcher, Andrej Karpathy, came up with to describe basically conjuring up whole programs, finished software, just by prompting a model. These models have always been able to auto-complete code, but they\u0026#39;ve gotten so good in the last year at coding that they can create whole projects involving lots of files and lots of folders, and everything. Actually, I started off doing it with my kid because I thought, \u0026#34;How do you teach a kid to make sense of AI?\u0026#34; And also, you\u0026#39;ve always thought it\u0026#39;s a good idea to get them to code. He loves games, so I thought, \u0026#34;Let\u0026#39;s code some games.\u0026#34;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eMichael Calore:\u003c/strong\u003e  Well, my experience is far less technical, because I recently had to make a change to a plane reservation through the Southwest app.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eLauren Goode:\u003c/strong\u003e  I\u0026#39;m sorry.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eMichael Calore:\u003c/strong\u003e  Yeah.

I gave it my confirmation number, my flight information. Then it said, \u0026#34;What change would you like to make?\u0026#34; I said, \u0026#34;I would like to do this.\u0026#34; They said, \u0026#34;We can do this for you with no fee.\u0026#34; I was like, \u0026#34;Great.\u0026#34; \u0026#34;Do you want to book it?\u0026#34; Yes. “OK, it\u0026#39;s booked.

You need to check in, but here\u0026#39;s the link to check in and get your new boarding pass.\u0026#34; I was like, \u0026#34;Wow.\u0026#34;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eLauren Goode:\u003c/strong\u003e  Is that the agent we\u0026#39;re talking about? That\u0026#39;s a customer service agent.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eMichael Calore:\u003c/strong\u003e  Right.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eLauren Goode:\u003c/strong\u003e  And it\u0026#39;s a bot replicating that. But this new era of agentic AI, tech companies raising millions of dollars and having valuations in the billions because they\u0026#39;re pivoting to agents, that\u0026#39;s not exactly what that is though, right?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eMichael Calore:\u003c/strong\u003e  Right. That\u0026#39;s a good question for Will. Can we throw this one to you, Will? What\u0026#39;s the difference between an AI agent what we\u0026#39;re talking about and a traditional chatbot, which most people have experienced?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eWill Knight:\u003c/strong\u003e  Right. The chatbot generates text and you can communicate with it through that very, very narrow domain of text. That\u0026#39;s been extraordinarily powerful. The revolution we\u0026#39;ve seen is built around these language models which can produce extraordinarily coherent and good answers to questions, that isn\u0026#39;t quite the same as an AI system that is inherently an agent. If you go back in the history of AI, actually, a lot of researchers have always worked on this idea that intelligence inherently involves agency. Humans are not things that just speak. They try and perform actions, you try and solve problems. That\u0026#39;s been a longstanding goal. It\u0026#39;s a weird quirk that we had these language models, which are so limited and kind of old-fashioned. A lot of what we\u0026#39;re seeing when it comes to agents out there are basically people taking language models and using the fact that they\u0026#39;re very general and very flexible to take a complex command and trigger some actions. The real leap that companies want to make is that the models themselves will decide and be able to formulate their actions themselves, more like an intelligent entity.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eLauren Goode:\u003c/strong\u003e  The human is still in the loop, but the human puts in a command or a prompt and then steps back. The agent is doing a bunch of AI stuff, basically while you go do other things. That\u0026#39;s the promise, that they\u0026#39;re going to be able to make us all hyper-productive.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eWill Knight:\u003c/strong\u003e  Yeah. Ideally, you would have an agent that would call up the airline for you. You tell it what you want to do and it goes and does the negotiation for you. Or you can give it much more open-ended commands or what you\u0026#39;re trying to achieve and it figures out how to do it for you. The language models are so general, so capable that in theory, they ought to be able to do that. But there are some really key catches when it comes to how you try and replicate human agency, because there\u0026#39;s a lot more going on in the world than just language. Agency actually involves more than just trying to solve an individual problem because it involves other people, which makes it complicated.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eMichael Calore:\u003c/strong\u003e  To say the least.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eWill Knight:\u003c/strong\u003e  Yes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eMichael Calore:\u003c/strong\u003e  Speaking of the models, it seems as though all of Silicon Valley has invested in developing their own AI agents, but who are the main players right now?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eWill Knight:\u003c/strong\u003e  The main players are the obvious ones. OpenAI, Anthropic, Google. I think Amazon is a good dark horse in this race. They hired some excels from OpenAI who made an agentic startup. They have a lab that they\u0026#39;re trying to build a lot of agents. One of the key things for these companies is where do you get the data from. They\u0026#39;re all desperately trying to figure out how you get data to train these agents. Instead of having just text, you want examples of things that people do. Amazon actually has quite a lot of good examples of that, of people doing stuff on its sites. They\u0026#39;re a good player.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eLauren Goode:\u003c/strong\u003e  Well, then in the coding world too, there are companies like Cursor. Tell us about that whole world, since you\u0026#39;ve been vibe coding with your son.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eWill Knight:\u003c/strong\u003e  Yeah. Yeah, there are a bunch of startups who\u0026#39;ve really ridden on the backs of the other AI companies, but really focused on coding. I think just because that\u0026#39;s moved so quickly, they\u0026#39;ve been able to carve out these niches. OpenAI is widely rumored to be looking to acquire one of these companies, Windsurf, for about three billion. Which gives you an indication of how they\u0026#39;ve been able to make this really great business for themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eLauren Goode:\u003c/strong\u003e  It seems like every briefing we are on these days, a company is talking about agents.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eMichael Calore:\u003c/strong\u003e  Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eLauren Goode:\u003c/strong\u003e  It ranges, too. It\u0026#39;s every company from Nvidia, to Microsoft, to well-funded startups. Even just earlier this week, a company called Glean, I\u0026#39;m pretty sure you guys have heard of it. It\u0026#39;s a company that has built a search engine for enterprise apps. They just raised 150 million in a series F round of funding. They are now valued at $7.2 billion. Their whole thing now is agents. It\u0026#39;s all about agents.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eWill Knight:\u003c/strong\u003e  I think the way to think about it is who is really building models that are trying to learn the general agency that you see in a language model, and that is OpenAI, these foundation model companies. You can go back to a previous era in AI when we had some of these game-playing AI systems, like AlphaZero. That used reinforcement learning, this process of experimenting. But it was fundamentally agentic. It only operates within a very limited world of a board game, but it\u0026#39;s taking actions, it\u0026#39;s figure out how to take those. What we\u0026#39;re seeing now with these AI companies mirrors that or is going back to that in a way, because they\u0026#39;re trying to get them to reason to a particular answer, to a particular end goal.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eMichael Calore:\u003c/strong\u003e  If we think about what role AI agents could play in the longterm, a lot of the companies that we\u0026#39;re talking about are starting with customer service. They\u0026#39;re starting with, OK, you have a simple question, you need something simple done. I can go figure that out for you, I can go accomplish that for you. I think that\u0026#39;s where most of the early strides are being made. Gartner, the tech market researcher, has put out an estimate that AI agents will resolve 80% of common customer service queries by the year 2029. That\u0026#39;s four years from now, AI agents will be doing all of our customer service stuff for us. Based on some of these examples that we\u0026#39;ve been talking about, it does seem like the automation of tasks currently performed by employees who are human is a common thread here.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eWill Knight:\u003c/strong\u003e  Yeah. I think the customer service is an obvious place to start because it involves taking what language models are brilliant at, which is talking to people and then trying to do a fairly limited number of things. A lot of these companies, the big AI players, are looking at going from coding to how you automate office work. There is a ton of repetitive tasks in office work. In theory, you could be able to use these models as the glue to figure out what someone\u0026#39;s trying to do and then replicate that. There\u0026#39;s already a huge amount of worry in the world of coding that this is going to eliminate lots of jobs. Then I think that there\u0026#39;s a good chance it\u0026#39;s going to come for much more routine white collar work as well.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eLauren Goode:\u003c/strong\u003e  Well, it\u0026#39;s been fun doing this podcast with you all.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eMichael Calore:\u003c/strong\u003e  We\u0026#39;ve mostly been focusing on how AI agents go out and do things, like surf the web, or call a restaurant, or fulfill some sort of task in a Microsoft Office product for you. But I\u0026#39;m curious about what the world of agentic AI looks like in our homes, on our physical devices. This has been at the top of a lot of people\u0026#39;s minds recently because OpenAI just announced that it made a deal with Jony Ive, the former and longtime head of design at Apple, to acquire a new startup that he launched to build a new class of AI devices for the home. How do we feel about this development?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eLauren Goode:\u003c/strong\u003e  It\u0026#39;s hard to say because we don\u0026#39;t know what form it\u0026#39;s going to take exactly yet. This is I think representative of a new generation of startups and hardware startups that are going to exist to serve these AIs. They\u0026#39;re built from the ground up with the future of artificial intelligence and ambient computing in mind. We don\u0026#39;t know exactly what form factor it\u0026#39;s going to take yet. Whether it\u0026#39;s going to be on your desktop, or it\u0026#39;s going to be on your body, or maybe both. Well, one, I do appreciate, I believe it was Jony Ive who said some version of, \u0026#34;We can all agree, we\u0026#39;re a little too attached to our iPhone.\u0026#34; The thing that they\u0026#39;ve invented is now, \u0026#34;We have to solve for the thing that we invented.\u0026#34; But the idea is can AI actually do enough so that it takes us away from having to be heads down or faces in screens all of the time, actually performing the actions? Can technology do some of that for us? And then free us up for other things. That\u0026#39;s always, in Silicon Valley, been one of promises of AI. I remember talking to Astro Teller from Google X years ago and asking him, \u0026#34;Well, what does this mean for jobs?\u0026#34; And him basically saying, \u0026#34;Well, with AI, people are just going to level up.\u0026#34; That\u0026#39;s always been a really sunny Silicon Valley optimistic view of AI. I think that there will be a new category of jobs and also tasks created that we haven\u0026#39;t maybe even thought of yet, but we still just have no idea how it\u0026#39;s actually going to work day-to-day into our lives.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eMichael Calore:\u003c/strong\u003e  Right. Because I feel like people have been trying this for a long time. Whenever we saw the demo for the next version of Siri, or the next version of Alexa, or the next version of Google Assistant, there was always a demo where they would ask the speaker, the voice-controlled smart speaker to order a pizza.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eLauren Goode:\u003c/strong\u003e  Yes, it was the pizza and the Uber, those were always the examples.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eMichael Calore:\u003c/strong\u003e  These are the deals that the device makers made with the businesses and they coded that in. When you ask Alexa, \u0026#34;Can you order a pizza,\u0026#34; it wasn\u0026#39;t calling Dominoes and Alexa\u0026#39;s voice ordering your pizza for you. It was just doing it on the web in an app, through an API basically. I think when you talk about what the next generation of that is, it\u0026#39;s you can ask it to do anything. What is that thing you\u0026#39;re asking? It\u0026#39;s some device that sits next to your computer and your phone? Why does it have to be a separate device? Why can it just be your computer and your phone is the big question that I have. Do we need something that\u0026#39;s going to probably cost several hundred dollars that\u0026#39;s probably going to be very beautiful that does a lot of what the other two devices that we already own do? I don\u0026#39;t really know. Everybody\u0026#39;s excited about it though because it\u0026#39;s Jony Ive and Sam Altman teamed up.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eLauren Goode:\u003c/strong\u003e  Right. It just becomes the delivery mechanism for whatever this new era of computing is. I do think too, the examples we\u0026#39;re talking about are very much a Wall-E kind of future. How lazy can we possibly be while we dispatch AI and machine learning to do the things for us? Whereas there\u0026#39;s also going to be space for how much more can I learn? What kind of knowledge can I obtain? What can I do differently because AI is helping me? There\u0026#39;s been this promise on the consumer end for a long time of this is going to change your day-to-day life by tapping into these small inconveniences that we have now. But I think the real gains stand to be, one, I don\u0026#39;t mean to sound too optimistic about this because I\u0026#39;m not entirely, but can we close gaps of knowledge because AI is actually going to help us do that in some way?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eWill Knight:\u003c/strong\u003e  Yeah. I think when it comes to OpenAI\u0026#39;s and Jony Ive thing, the models are getting increasingly really good at interpreting the visual world and interacting through speech. I think there\u0026#39;s this idea in the ethos that you can have completely new, a new interface, you can reimagine the interface entirely. You don\u0026#39;t have this graphical user interface. God knows what they\u0026#39;re going to come up. Google has demoed this with this Project Astra, where you wear these glasses and you can talk about what\u0026#39;s around you. I\u0026#39;ve tried that. It\u0026#39;s kind of impressive. Yeah, maybe there\u0026#39;s new ways you can order pizzas with it. But also, I can\u0026#39;t help thinking about the fact that they need the data for what people are doing increasingly to train these models as well. I feel like the hardware makers have so much interesting data. They don\u0026#39;t really tend to tap into it because of privacy issues, but maybe OpenAI will find a way. Then in the issue of how you train, the knowledge gap, I think that\u0026#39;s a really, really important point because automation often causes people\u0026#39;s skills to atrophy. You see it in autopilot in aircraft. Then you\u0026#39;re definitely seeing coders saying they\u0026#39;re losing skills because they rely too much on that. What does that mean for the workforce?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eLauren Goode:\u003c/strong\u003e  Right. If all of these AI agents free us up to do other things, what exactly are they going to free us up to do? How are we going to fill that time? In our ultra-capitalist, some people may call it end stage capitalist society, the answer is probably, \u0026#34;Well, you can just be more productive. You can just do more, more, more.\u0026#34; I think it\u0026#39;s going to be up to us, the humans, to push back against that and say, \u0026#34;Here\u0026#39;s how we actually want to fill our time.\u0026#34; There are also going to be these little bottlenecks for a while that I think are going to make these more complicated than anything else. When I was at Google IO a few weeks ago, I got a demo, Will, of their Project Mariner. Have you seen this yet?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eWill Knight:\u003c/strong\u003e  Yeah, I\u0026#39;ve tried that. Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eLauren Goode:\u003c/strong\u003e  You have tried it? I don\u0026#39;t know if this was the demo they gave you, but the experience I saw, it scanned a cocktail recipe. Then it automatically just grabbed the ingredients from the cocktail and put it in an Instacart shopping cart. But then, it hit a bottleneck because there was no authentication for the Instacart account. It was like, \u0026#34;Oh, hold on, we have to log in.\u0026#34; Then some demo-er was trying to log into Instacart. \u0026#34;But look, it\u0026#39;s so seamless.\u0026#34; I\u0026#39;m like, \u0026#34;No, I literally could have just added that to Instacart.\u0026#34;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eWill Knight:\u003c/strong\u003e  Yeah. Their examples always seem to involve buying something for some reason.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eMichael Calore:\u003c/strong\u003e  Why do we think that there is such a laser focus on AI agents at the moment in Silicon Valley? Is it the Valley\u0026#39;s tendency to always just need a new goal to race towards? Is it indicative of something larger? Is it what VCs are most interested in funding? What\u0026#39;s the reason here?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eWill Knight:\u003c/strong\u003e  From my perspective, one of the main reasons is that, going back to the history of AI, this is really the next step you would take in building something that\u0026#39;s getting closer to human-like AI or AGI, or whatever you want to call it. A lot of researchers are very interested in doing that. I think there is also a ton of potential. Chatting to a chatbot is useful if you want to do lots of things, answer lots of questions. But the idea that you could automate a lot of work or mundane chores is potentially valuable.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eLauren Goode:\u003c/strong\u003e  Yeah. I think that if you\u0026#39;re on the startup side of things, this is where the money is flowing right now. We\u0026#39;ve been in this era for a while where interest rates are really high. For some startups, it hasn\u0026#39;t been easy to raise capital. There\u0026#39;s been a bit of a pause on the IPO market that has cooled a bit. Although, now there\u0026#39;s signs that it\u0026#39;s picking up again. I think the threat of tariffs still looming over people\u0026#39;s heads in Silicon Valley. If you\u0026#39;ve been iterating on your software, and suddenly you can say to your would-be investors, \u0026#34;But, wait. We\u0026#39;re pivoting to agents. We\u0026#39;re doing this agentic AI. We\u0026#39;re going to be able to sell this software into other businesses, and also we\u0026#39;re going to streamline our own processes and reduce our own overhead costs.\u0026#34; It\u0026#39;s probably a path to raising right now. Is some of it hype? Sure, it is. But as Will is saying, because, Will, you\u0026#39;re so steeped in the research and development side of this, actually there\u0026#39;s some pretty notable advancements being made, too.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eMichael Calore:\u003c/strong\u003e  Let\u0026#39;s take a break right now, and we\u0026#39;ll come right back. The development of agents is going forward full-throttle, but as we were just talking about, the current agents that we\u0026#39;re able to use have some significant limitations. But quickly, what are some of the other concerns behind the growth of AI agents? Not just about usability, but about the other things that they do.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eLauren Goode:\u003c/strong\u003e  Well, I think reliability is certainly one issue because they\u0026#39;re still subject to the same kind of hallucinations, and errors, and even sycophancy that the LLMs are. You\u0026#39;re also introducing much more complex queries into it because you\u0026#39;re not just asking it to run a search for you. You\u0026#39;re asking it to perform multiple steps under certain conditions. There are also concerns around high cost in compute power. Then there\u0026#39;s selling the product itself. The Information recently reported that OpenAI might charge up to $20,000 per month for some of its more specialized AI agents. Supposedly, these are agents that would be able to perform at the level of expertise of a PhD graduate, supposedly. On the one hand, that\u0026#39;s really, really expensive. On the other hand, our colleague Paresh Dave has been reporting how some people in the industry believe that\u0026#39;s actually not that much money. Because ultimately, if these agents replace jobs, which is what they might do, then you\u0026#39;re saving on all of those salary costs. It might actually be something of a bargain. Right now though, there\u0026#39;s a bit of sticker shock around that.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eWill Knight:\u003c/strong\u003e  Yeah, I think that\u0026#39;s very true. There are a bunch of other issues, things that could go wrong and probably will go wrong. A bunch of researchers that I spoke to ... I spoke to Zico Kolter at CMU who is also on the board of OpenAI who\u0026#39;s been looking at the security of agents, and just introducing agents that are going to, ideally in future, interact with other agents. You have this amplifying effect that could be very difficult to predict. As Lauren says, also the idea of these things buying things inherently makes them a much juicier target for hackers. If you have something like Mariner using the web, it\u0026#39;s really interesting just to think about the idea that people will maybe try and reinvent SEO to work for agents. One of the more fundamental problems I think is that these aren\u0026#39;t really actually replicating human agency. There\u0026#39;s a really interesting book on this, to go into the weeds, called The Evolution of Agency. Where if you look at animals and how their agency has evolved, when you get to humans, there\u0026#39;s a very fundamental difference in the way human agency works and it involves working with other humans. It involves collaborating and knowing that you often have to sacrifice things to work together. You have things like guilt, you have empathy that evolved. These models, we\u0026#39;re seeing examples of models doing really crazy things in contrived examples, where they\u0026#39;re told they\u0026#39;re going to be switched off and then they\u0026#39;ll blackmail someone. That is not actually necessarily an example of an evil model, it could be just an example of a model that hasn\u0026#39;t learned how we\u0026#39;d expect a person to behave all the time. Yeah, that could have a lot of unforeseen consequences.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eMichael Calore:\u003c/strong\u003e  I think my biggest concern is something that you touched on, Lauren, which is the fact that, as the hype and the excitement around AI agents ramps up, that a lot of companies are going to be looking at them as a way to reduce labor costs. There\u0026#39;s nothing inherently wrong about reducing labor costs, but I feel like there is something inherently wrong about replacing an entire class of workers at a company with machines. It is quite literally dehumanizing. And I mean that not only in the jokey sense that you\u0026#39;re getting rid of humans, but also just that the people working there and the customers that are interacting with your company are now going to feel alienated from you because they no longer have that human interaction that they\u0026#39;re used to. We\u0026#39;re already seeing that happening. That\u0026#39;s the kind of thing that excites people who are very concerned about the bottom line, and worries people who are concerned about things income and equality, and all the problems that come along with this rampant push towards mechanization. We\u0026#39;ve been dealing with this as a society for 150 years, and I feel like as the technology gets more powerful, that those worries just accelerate.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eLauren Goode:\u003c/strong\u003e  In the past week alone, I\u0026#39;ve heard a venture capitalist and a CEO say in separate interviews, this quote about how \u0026#34;six out of 10 jobs, 60% of jobs that exist now didn\u0026#39;t exist back in 1940.\u0026#34; Things change, things shift, technology enables new kinds of jobs. Futurists, CEOs, venture capitalists, they love this because it creates this blank space for what we haven\u0026#39;t been able to imagine yet, in terms of what jobs will exist. Do I believe that there are some jobs that Will\u0026#39;s son who he\u0026#39;s vibe coding with right now could potentially have that we haven\u0026#39;t even thought of yet?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eMichael Calore:\u003c/strong\u003e  Is everyone in Silicon Valley thinking about AI agents in the same way?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eWill Knight:\u003c/strong\u003e  I don\u0026#39;t think they are. I think there\u0026#39;s a lot of enthusiasm, but there\u0026#39;s also a ton of different definitions. Recently, I spoke to Sonya Huang, a partner at Sequoia who tracks AI. She was saying that most agents startups, most of the companies offering agents, are really just rebranding existing AI tools as agents.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eLauren Goode:\u003c/strong\u003e  Yeah. To Will\u0026#39;s earlier point, there\u0026#39;s no real clear definition of what an AI agent is right now or what it\u0026#39;s supposed to be. There\u0026#39;s really a wide spectrum, so companies can move the needle and define it however they want to. Or say they\u0026#39;re offering it in a certain way. I think that we\u0026#39;re going to also see I think something maybe of a cottage industry pop up around the spaces in between agentic AI. Let\u0026#39;s say for example, there is an authentication bottleneck that happens when you dispatch an agent to complete a bunch of different tasks online through a bunch of different apps. There\u0026#39;s needs to be some kind of connection there between those apps, and it needs to be safe and secure. I think you\u0026#39;re going to see solutions emerge for that. I think you\u0026#39;re going to see some version of last mile shipping, but for coding. Because right now, there\u0026#39;s a lot of vibe coding happening and people talking about vibe coding, and \u0026#34;look what this bot can do for me.\u0026#34; But not all of that code is actually shippable. You have to be able to debug it and you have to be able to ship it. It has to run, it has to work. I think you\u0026#39;ll start to see more and more startups and companies trying to offer solutions to all these little gaps and bottlenecks that exist between the AI agents. Then our jobs will be taken fully. Good times.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eMichael Calore:\u003c/strong\u003e  Will, for people like us who are consumers of this technology ... We\u0026#39;re not vibe coding like Will.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eLauren Goode:\u003c/strong\u003e  Not yet.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eMichael Calore:\u003c/strong\u003e  By and large, we\u0026#39;re encountering agentic AI in some form in our daily lives. As it becomes more prevalent, how can we assess its potential and its risks in a levelheaded way?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eWill Knight:\u003c/strong\u003e  First of all, I think you should all be vibe coding. I\u0026#39;m making all manner of garbage. When I\u0026#39;m vibe coding, I very consciously do it on a machine where I don\u0026#39;t mind if it deletes a bunch of files, because it is really unpredictable and will sometimes do that. I don\u0026#39;t really know how you do that for something that you\u0026#39;re going to let loose on your shopping. Do you have a budget that you just let the agent spend? I think that\u0026#39;s a great question. The risk is obviously all going to be put entirely on us, I should imagine.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eMichael Calore:\u003c/strong\u003e  Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eLauren Goode:\u003c/strong\u003e  Yeah. But I think as these agents get better and better at doing tasks for us, we have at least a few responsibilities. One is we do have to disrupt ourselves and our habits and learn how to use new tools because they\u0026#39;re going to take over our lives. Two, we have to figure out where we fit in as humans and retain some of that human agency and still participate, stay in the loop, still participate in our own lives, not just let tech take it over. Three, we have to think really hard about the ethics and the privacy and security of what these AI agents are doing as they take over people\u0026#39;s lives. The promise from all the optimists is that this is going to close the equality gap. Once again, it\u0026#39;s going to be great for everybody. We know almost for certain this is not going to be great for everybody.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eMichael Calore:\u003c/strong\u003e  Yeah. That\u0026#39;s why I\u0026#39;m the opposite of the optimists at this point. I think that great caution and great skepticism are things that are given here. We need to make sure that when we adopt these technologies, we do so in a way that is very, very thoughtful and cautious. This is something that feels familiar. Probably the most recent example is the phone, the smartphone. Something that causes friction in relationships, it\u0026#39;s something that you can pay attention to and you can ignore humans. You can use it to interact with other humans, you can use it to not interact with other humans. This force that has really eroded a small part of our humanity over the 15 or 20 years that this has been part of our lives. I can see that happening with AI agents as the things that we used to rely on people to do and the things that used to force us to interact with each other go away. I have the same experience whenever I ride in a Waymo instead of riding in an Uber or taking a taxi. The fact that now there\u0026#39;s no human in the equation, there\u0026#39;s no person to interact with. By doing that over and over again, I am slowly eroding my own sense of what it means to be a human being. I know it sounds really esoteric, but you can chart it over time and you\u0026#39;ll probably find that you\u0026#39;re feeling the same way in your own life. I would encourage people to make that decision about how they want to use AI agents. If they don\u0026#39;t feel like this is something that belongs in their lives, that they should vote with their dollars.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eWill Knight:\u003c/strong\u003e  Maybe we also need a renewed open source movement so we\u0026#39;re not just using agents that belong and funnel data to these giant companies.

I\u0026#39;m going to hold it up, which is great radio. This book, which is  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eThe Evolution of Agency\u003c/em\u003e  by Michael Tomasello. I found it just fascinating and really revealing about what\u0026#39;s missing with AI when it comes to agency, and the importance of understanding human social interaction, human culture. When it comes to the big picture of intelligence in AGI, which everybody talks about, but they don\u0026#39;t really talk about that so much.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eMichael Calore:\u003c/strong\u003e  Nice.

They do a fantastic job. There\u0026#39;s a lot going on in US cities right now, in particular Los Angeles, and also in San Francisco. There are ICE raids happening around the country and people are taking to the streets to protest them. Mission Local has been doing a great job covering what\u0026#39;s been going on in San Francisco so far. I recommend that you support them and support your local news if you can.

It is by the Norwegian writer Karl Ove Knausgaard who, Lauren, I\u0026#39;m sure you\u0026#39;re sick of me talking about. But it\u0026#39;s a fantastic essay. It\u0026#39;s called “The Reenchanted World.” It is Karl Ove reckoning with technology. He tells you about the first time he encountered a computer, which was 40 years ago. Then he just has not paid attention to computers at all and it starts to bother him. There\u0026#39;s a great quote near the top. \u0026#34;To keep somewhat informed about the political situation in the world is a duty, something one has no right to turn away from. Shouldn\u0026#39;t something similar apply to technology, given the immensity of it influence?\u0026#34; I love that quote, because it really gets to the center of what we\u0026#39;re talking about today. In order to engage with the world, you need to understand how these systems work. He goes to a Greek island to visit the writer James Bridle, because their book  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eWays of Being\u003c/em\u003e  is a really good introduction to intelligence and artificial intelligence and natural intelligence. They talk a lot about artificial intelligence and how its developed and how the various ways of computing intelligence have shown up in our lives.

Typically, as a professional mattress tester of over five years, I’d tell you it differs from person to person. But there are always the rare few models that manage to pull off the near impossible for a mattress to accomplish: being a supportive and comfortable fit for anybody, regardless of build or sleeping position. The Nolah Evolution Hybrid is one of those mattresses, and one of the rare few near-perfect beds I\u0026#39;ve tested to date.

AirFoam is also meant to sleep cooler, since sucking in body heat is a known problem with memory foam. Can I prove that these things are actually at play when I sleep on a mattress? Scientifically, no—I can’t necessarily break out the beakers in the bedroom. But what I can tell you is that the model I regularly use, the luxury firm, does a swell job with pressure relief and lumbar support.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis mattress’s full government name used to be the “Nolah Evolution 15,” with the number denoting the full height of the mattress. It’s definitely a taller mattress, and I use a frame lower to the ground to accommodate that (and my dogs’ smaller legs). The newer iterations of the Nolah Evolution have the upgrade option of throwing on a  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/organic-mattress-and-bedding-certifications/' class='link'\u003eGlacio-Tex\u003c/a\u003e -covered pillow top, which from other Nolah models I can tell you is very much cool to the touch. The standard pillow top’s organic cotton cover (which I have the most experience with) is breathable, but it isn’t going to give you that refrigerator-opening-blast-in-the-face coolness. The pillow top is your first pass at getting pressure relief from the mattress, and it lets the heavier areas of your body sink in a bit so they’re not chafing against the mattress. So,  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/gallery/side-sleeper-beds/' class='link'\u003eside sleepers\u003c/a\u003e , pay attention to what I’m saying here. It’s our top-tested pick for y’all for a reason!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, the pillow top isn’t doing all the heavy lifting for temperature control and pressure relief. A “Heat Escape Gusset” encircles the pillow top, which is essentially just mesh that is supposed to let heat escape from within the pillow top. After the pillow top comes the “Zoned AirFoam HD” layer—a fancy way of saying that this layer is for advanced pressure relief due to both the foam structure and perforation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class='AssetEmbedWrapper-eVDQiB byBkf asset-embed'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cpicture class='ResponsiveImagePicture-cWuUZO dUOtEa AssetEmbedResponsiveAsset-cXBNxi lqMXz asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image'\u003e\u003cimg src='https://media.wired.com/photos/684cf179ddb66e5a16c7c73c/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Nolah%2520Evolution_%2520SOURCE-Julia%2520Forbes(1).png' alt='Image may contain Furniture Mattress and Bed'\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003ePhotograph: Julia Forbes\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003caside\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cpicture class='ResponsiveImagePicture-cWuUZO dUOtEa responsive-image'\u003e\u003cimg src='https://media.wired.com/photos/684cf001e0d5a3886cb6c6db/1:1/w_150%2Cc_limit/Review-%2520Nolah%2520Evolution.png' alt='Nolah Evolution' class='mt-4 p-2 max-w-full h-auto rounded shadow-sm'\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eNolah Evolution\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRating: 9/10\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003ca href='https://cna.st/p/CjNb2fje8XMy8fitSuVQNVx8eqGfdur3vFZsPVgTem8tevRLwrSTxhnB9HUHx25HosbRGL6qnL9mffzwoumfnarT1VmWpPSNwrWFj7Y9zB15jTsG4p8Rv4GtSAxxFYw7tvwbwYZf5ZFZcNNHF8WzEiKkZMW9KcT2GZ5soL8p4dsnNtSax5gHEh8BirnsB9XsuYDB78HmaeVTWa7JGQcdoEaJTcZTcBYsvmDF15nd8nHLafJxSwzUCriERgKaHk' class='link'\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cdel\u003e$2,127\u003c/del\u003e \u003cspan\u003e$1,383\u003c/span\u003e at Nolah\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eAll products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors.

A 2-inch layer of comfort foam follows for—you guessed it—more pressure relief, along with a transition layer protecting the foam from the coil core. The coils are pocketed, allowing each one to react to your body instead of making it a group project like traditional innerspring beds of old. They’re also reinforced in the center and along the edges, which is just an extra-firm feel to keep these particular areas extra-supported. Lastly, everything is set up on a foam base, which lets the coils really do their thing without being compressed by contact with your bed frame.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2 class='text-xl font-semibold'\u003eUltimate Sleep Experience\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cfigure class='AssetEmbedWrapper-eVDQiB byBkf asset-embed'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cpicture class='ResponsiveImagePicture-cWuUZO dUOtEa AssetEmbedResponsiveAsset-cXBNxi lqMXz asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image'\u003e\u003cimg src='https://media.wired.com/photos/684cf191f24901c2a4cb5b55/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Nolah%2520Evolution_%2520SOURCE-Julia%2520Forbes(3).png' alt='Image may contain Furniture Mattress Person Accessories Bag and Handbag'\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eOK, enough shop talk. Here’s what I like from testing this mattress. I remember when Nolah first launched the Evolution back in 2020, and it was touted as a good option for side sleepers with all the pressure relief and lumbar support features. When I eventually tried it (and various iterations afterward), it consistently delivered on these marks. Something that has always stood out to me as a major value add was the three firmness options available: plush, luxury firm, and firm. Having a variety of firmnesses is an easy way to make a mattress more accessible to all kinds of sleepers, especially with different body types and sleeping positions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI landed on “luxury firm” for a couple of reasons, chief among them being that I’m part of a dynamic sleeping duo. In other words, my husband is a back sleeper, and I’m a stomach sleeper (who is desperately trying to be a side sleeper, mind you). All to say, these sleeping positions can require different firmness levels for adequate support, preferences not even being factored in. Luxury firm is the middle ground, and we’ve found it to be a welcoming amount of softness that doesn’t cancel out the feeling of support.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile I\u0026#39;m on my side, my hips and shoulders get hugged, and if I’m on my stomach, my lower back stays lifted. Everything remains relatively on the same level—hips, lower back, and shoulders—which is what you want for even spine alignment. When on your back, your spine curves away from the bed, but the pillow top takes up that space nicely. That way your back doesn’t feel like it’s being left out support-wise, and this eliminates a potential cause of  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-mattresses-for-back-pain/' class='link'\u003eback pain\u003c/a\u003e .\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003caside\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cpicture class='ResponsiveImagePicture-cWuUZO dUOtEa responsive-image'\u003e\u003cimg src='https://media.wired.com/photos/684cf001e0d5a3886cb6c6db/1:1/w_150%2Cc_limit/Review-%2520Nolah%2520Evolution.png' alt='Nolah Evolution' class='mt-4 p-2 max-w-full h-auto rounded shadow-sm'\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eNolah Evolution\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRating: 9/10\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003ca href='https://cna.st/p/CjNb2fje8XMy8fitSuVQNVx8eqGfdur3vFZsPVgTem8tevRLwrSTxhnB9HUHx25HosbRGL6qnL9mffzwoumfnarT1VmWpPSNwrWFj7Y9zB15jTsG4p8Rv4GtSAxxFYw7tvwbwYZf5ZFZcNNHF8WzEiKkZMW9KcT2GZ5soL8p4dsnNtSax5gHEh8BirnsB9XsuYDB78HmaeVTWa7JGQcdoEaJTcZTcBYsvmDF15nd8nHLafJxSwzUCriERgKaHk' class='link'\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cdel\u003e$2,127\u003c/del\u003e \u003cspan\u003e$1,383\u003c/span\u003e at Nolah\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eAll products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors.

I’m often relegated to the very edge of the mattress while my dogs stretch out (a mother’s sacrifice, I tell you). The reinforced coils are fine for supporting you while lying down, and your weight is evenly distributed across them.

Granted, I’ve only ever tested versions with the organic cotton cover, as the new and improved Glacio-Tex cover is a new development.

(That same week, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told  \u003ca href='https://stratechery.com/2025/an-interview-with-nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-about-chip-controls-ai-factories-and-enterprise-pragmatism/' class='link'\u003eStratechery\u003c/a\u003e  that he would hire an AI agent for $100,000 per year “in a heartbeat.” )\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePreviously, Brescia worked as the chief operating officer of GitHub, which helped set the bar for AI pricing.

Brescia says GitHub went with a price that would attract a critical mass of users. The goal was gathering data to improve the service, and GitHub’s parent company, Microsoft, didn’t mind taking a loss on the new tool to make that happen. In reality, a price 100 times higher would now better reflect the value Copilot provides to software developers, Brescia estimates. (GitHub chief operating officer Kyle Daigle tells WIRED that the company’s goal is to support, not replace, developers and that “pricing reflects a commitment to democratizing access to powerful tools.”)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eToday, Copilot tops out at $21 a month. And similar tools have followed its lead, including Zed, which has received $12.5 million in funding from Redpoint and others. In May, the company started charging a minimum of $20 a month for an AI-assisted code editor it built from the ground up.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eZed CEO Nathan Sobo expects AI companies to charge more over time because the current pricing models aren’t sustainable. But relative to humans, he wants to keep AI agents affordable so anyone can use them to augment their work, develop better software, and create new jobs. “I want as much intelligence at my disposal at as low a cost as possible,” he says. “But to me, included in that is potentially a junior engineer using this technology, ideally at as low a cost as possible.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDecagon’s Zhang feels the same way about AI coding tools. “Would we pay more? Marginally? Yeah,” he says. But “$2,000? Probably not.” He adds “the hunger for good engineers is infinite.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAI entrepreneurs suggest that agents could command higher prices if they were easier to set up and more reliable to use. For instance, Nandita Giri, a senior software engineer who has worked at Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft, says she would pay thousands of dollars annually for an AI personal assistant. “But strict conditions apply—you can’t get frustrated by using it,” she says.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, that day feels far away. As a personal project, Giri tried developing an AI agent that could prevent psychological burnout. “It just canceled all my meetings,” she says. Certainly a solution, but not the ideal one.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow, some companies are hiring “AI architects” to help oversee agentic systems and cut down on gaffes. The question is who will occupy those roles in the future if early-career workers are cut off from opportunities today. Simon Johnson, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, doesn\u0026#39;t expect companies to take into account the social cost of career disruption in making their pricing decisions. He suggests governments lower payroll taxes for entry-level roles to encourage hiring. “The right lever to pull is one that reduces costs to employers,” Johnson says.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eArrigoni is choosing a third path. At Loti AI, he has prioritized steadily hiring junior engineers and hasn\u0026#39;t employed AI coding tools.

Umbrella-shaped outbursts of magmatic matter rocketed into space from all over Io’s surface. “They looked amazingly beautiful,” said Bolton, who is now based at the Southwest Research Institute in Texas. “It was like an artist drew it.

According to Nimmo, “there’s a fundamental difference between a liquid-water ocean and a magma ocean. The magma wants to escape; the water really doesn’t.” Liquid rock is less dense than solid rock, so it wants to rise and erupt quickly; the new study suggests that it doesn’t linger at depth long enough inside Io to form a massive, interconnected ocean. But liquid water is, unusually, denser than its solid icy form. “Liquid water is heavy, so it collects into an ocean,” Sori said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“I think that’s the big-picture message from this paper,” Sori added. Tidal heating might struggle to create magma oceans. But on icy moons, it can easily make watery oceans due to the bizarrely low density of ice.

Experienced coders, like Yegge, can give AI tools instructions and then watch AI bring complex ideas to life.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSeveral AI-coding startups, including Cursor and Windsurf have ridden a wave of interest in the approach. (OpenAI is widely rumored to be in talks to acquire Windsurf).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt the same time, the obvious limitations of generative AI, including the way models confabulate and become confused, has led many seasoned programmers to see AI-assisted coding—and especially gung-ho, no-hands vibe coding—as a potentially dangerous new fad.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMartin Casado, a computer scientist and general partner at Andreessen Horowitz who sits on the board of Cursor, says the idea that AI will replace human coders is overstated. “AI is great at doing dazzling things, but not good at doing specific things,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStill, Casado has been stunned by the pace of recent progress. “I had no idea it would get this good this quick,” he says. “This is the most dramatic shift in the art of computer science since assembly was supplanted by higher-level languages.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eKen Thompson, vice president of engineering at Anaconda, a company that provides open source code for software development, says AI adoption tends to follow a generational divide, with younger developers diving in and older ones showing more caution. For all the hype, he says many developers still do not trust AI tools because their output is unpredictable, and will vary from one day to the next, even when given the same prompt. “The nondeterministic nature of AI is too risky, too dangerous,” he explains.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBoth Casado and Thompson see the vibe-coding shift as less about replacement than abstraction, mimicking the way that new languages like Python build on top of lower-level languages like C, making it easier and faster to write code. New languages have typically broadened the appeal of programming and increased the number of practitioners. AI could similarly increase the number of people capable of producing working code.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 class='text-xl font-semibold'\u003eBad Vibes\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eParadoxically, the vibe-coding boom suggests that a solid grasp of coding remains as important as ever.

Sometimes an AI model may take an instruction and execute better than the developer—other times it might do the task much worse.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJackson adds that vibe coding falls down when anyone is building serious software. “There are almost no applications in which ‘mostly works’ is good enough,” he says. “As soon as you care about a piece of software, you care that it works right.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMany software projects are complex, and changes to one section of code can cause problems elsewhere in the system.

He expects that AI may replace some developers but will also force many more to rethink their approach and focus more on project design.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eToo much reliance on AI may be “a bit of an impending disaster,” Jackson adds, because “not only will we have masses of broken code, full of security vulnerabilities, but we\u0026#39;ll have a new generation of programmers incapable of dealing with those vulnerabilities.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 class='text-xl font-semibold'\u003eLearn to Code\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eEven firms that have already integrated coding tools into their software development process say the technology remains far too unreliable for wider use.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eChristine Yen, CEO at Honeycomb, a company that provides technology for monitoring the performance of large software systems, says that projects that are simple or formulaic, like building component libraries, are more amenable to using AI. Even so, she says the developers at her company who use AI in their work have only increased their productivity by about 50 percent.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYen adds that for anything requiring good judgement, where performance is important, or where the resulting code touches sensitive systems or data, “AI just frankly isn\u0026#39;t good enough yet to be additive.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“The hard part about building software systems isn\u0026#39;t just writing a lot of code,” she says. “Engineers are still going to be necessary, at least today, for owning that curation, judgment, guidance and direction.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOthers suggest that a shift in the workforce is coming. “We are not seeing less demand for developers,” says Liad Elidan, CEO of Milestone, a company that helps firms measure the impact of generative AI projects. “We are seeing less demand for average or low-performing developers.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“If I\u0026#39;m building a product, I could have needed 50 engineers and now maybe I only need 20 or 30,” says Naveen Rao, VP of AI at Databricks, a company that helps large businesses build their own AI systems. “That is absolutely real.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRao says, however, that learning to code should remain a valuable skill for some time. “It’s like saying ‘Don\u0026#39;t teach your kid to learn math,’” he says. Understanding how to get the most out of computers is likely to remain extremely valuable, he adds.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYegge and Kim, the veteran coders, believe that most developers can adapt to the coming wave.

In the end, connecting with the rope isn’t the solution to everything. Higgs [Monaghan] will tell you something similar in the game: to connect, you also need a stick. The further you go into the game, the better you will understand what Higgs means.

It comes from a very intimate place, from thoughts like a sense of loneliness, the mystery of where the dead go, and the pain of not having had a true goodbye with someone we have lost.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class='AssetEmbedWrapper-eVDQiB byBkf asset-embed'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cpicture class='ResponsiveImagePicture-cWuUZO dUOtEa AssetEmbedResponsiveAsset-cXBNxi lqMXz asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image'\u003e\u003cimg src='https://media.wired.com/photos/68435cab554c00630cfd8fb9/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/09_Environment.jpg' alt='Hideo Kojima'\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cp\u003eTransportation in  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eDeath Stranding 2\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003eCourtesy of Kojima Productions\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch2 class='text-xl font-semibold'\u003eThe Birth of \u003cem class='italic'\u003eDeath Stranding 2\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe new  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eDeath Stranding\u003c/em\u003e  expands and improves on every element of the game’s first installment.

The  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eDeath Stranding\u003c/em\u003e  saga seems to be following a similar evolution: “For  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eDeath Stranding 2: On the Beach\u003c/em\u003e , I used the same approach. At the beginning it was a game focused on deliveries, something no one had ever seen before, so some people might feel frustrated by that.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“But now the public is familiar with the idea, so I wanted to give players more freedom, even those who want to fight, for example.

Indeed, the game is now much more focused on firefights, but the main thing was, above all else, the ability to give players a choice in how they approach the various missions—something that doesn’t force them to fight at all costs: “Well, I don’t want to suggest to people that they focus on combat or anything like that, but there are a lot of players all over the world asking me to make another  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eMetal Gear\u003c/em\u003e , so here too I added more options for combat.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e“This, however, is still a game focused primarily on deliveries.

In case he chooses combat, we had to change the design of the weapons to make them easier to use. When we were working on these mechanics, I was a little worried, because many of the team members who worked with me on  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eMetal Gear\u003c/em\u003e  still work with me, and we kept asking ourselves, ‘Does this feel too  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eMetal Gear\u003c/em\u003e ?’ but we didn’t do it deliberately.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis freer approach was also shared by his colleagues: Yoji Shinkawa, art director of character and mechanical design, who has worked with Kojima since M \u003cem class='italic'\u003eetal Gear Solid\u003c/em\u003e ; Hirohaki Yoshiike, lead level designer; Takayuki Uchida, technical art director, lead environment artist; and, finally, Akio Sakamoto, chief technology officer, technical director.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhether in exploration, combat, or stealth, the development team’s approach has always been to provide the player with the tools to act as he or she prefers, which is why over the years they have focused heavily on improving gunfights and stealth, incorporating new weapons, new mechanics and the ability to adapt Sam’s character to each user’s play style.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class='AssetEmbedWrapper-eVDQiB byBkf asset-embed'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cpicture class='ResponsiveImagePicture-cWuUZO dUOtEa AssetEmbedResponsiveAsset-cXBNxi lqMXz asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image'\u003e\u003cimg src='https://media.wired.com/photos/68435cab554c00630cfd8fbb/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/14_Stealth.jpg' alt='Hideo Kojima'\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem class='italic'\u003eDeath Stranding 2\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003eCourtesy of Kojima Productions\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eKojima says Mexico was a natural choice to continue the path that started with the first game, even though it wasn’t his original plan: “In  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eDeath Stranding\u003c/em\u003e  you connected the North American continent from east to west, mirroring the exploration of the American frontier.

This portal connecting the continents provides some interesting possibilities for sequels: “The concept of the Plate Gate would allow me to create infinite sequels! I obviously have no plans to do that, but I do have an idea in mind for one possible one. I don’t think I will make it, but if I passed the project on to someone else, they probably could.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eKojima says he decided to introduce a day/night cycle to give players the freedom to choose their favorite time of day to play, as it will be possible to change the time simply by sleeping in Sam’s room. This choice, however, has led to some minor problems in the direction of the cutscenes, which are also managed in real time according to the time of day.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe mentions how important it is for him to analyze player behavior in his games, particularly with regard to the asynchronous multiplayer of the first  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eDeath Stranding\u003c/em\u003e , which allows players to share objects and constructions, such as bridges and ladders, with other users. Kojima is surprised by the success that the highways have had, and especially the fact that even today, five years after the launch of the first chapter, there are still people who continue to build and maintain them.

He went on to explain the meaning of likes, which work very much like social media likes in the game: “A like is not a currency—you don’t get any items or become stronger because of them. The team was very hesitant about adding them at first. They are closer to likes in the real world. They have no concrete value, but they make you feel good. From a game design point of view, it’s strange. Normally you accumulate points and get a rank or rewards, but in our case the like is just a personal incentive. It’s exactly like on social.

I think we started performance capture in 2021. At that time I couldn’t go to Los Angeles to direct; the studio wouldn’t allow it. It was like that for all the studios.

Is this a business machine meant primarily for office work and other simple tasks that can be done in a browser? Or perhaps you have a burgeoning interest in a hobby like PC gaming, video editing, coding, or design. Maybe one of those hobbies is more of a job for you, meaning you\u0026#39;ll want something that is designed from the ground up to accelerate work in those applications. On the other side of the spectrum, maybe you plan to primarily use your laptop on the go, whether that\u0026#39;s on the plane or in coffee shops. In that case, portability and battery life may be the most important factors to consider.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe answer to those questions is what will help point you in the right direction and ensure that you don\u0026#39;t overspend on features or performance that you don\u0026#39;t need. For example, buying a MacBook Pro instead of a MacBook Air just because you have extra money to spend isn\u0026#39;t a good idea. That brings us to budget: $1,000 is an important price. There are lots of really good options below that price, but it\u0026#39;s the level at which you can expect laptops to feel premium and lack any significant compromises.

Most of the premium thin-and-light laptops this year come with the V-series chip, which is Intel\u0026#39;s answer to the highly efficient Qualcomm Snapdragon X chips, and are actually fabricated by TSMC instead of Intel. They get great battery life and have the best integrated graphics of the available chips for Windows laptops. Meanwhile, you\u0026#39;ll find U-series chips in cheaper laptops, while H and HX chips are primarily in gaming or content creation laptops.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eQualcomm Processors\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eQualcomm made a  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/what-is-copilot-plus-pc/' class='link'\u003ehuge splash in the Windows laptop space\u003c/a\u003e  in 2024, debuting the Snapdragon X line of chips and thoroughly disrupting Intel\u0026#39;s hold on laptop CPUs. Over the past year, we\u0026#39;ve tested a number of these laptops and found them to be competitive not only with Intel\u0026#39;s latest chips but also with the latest Apple M4 silicon.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere are three options: the Snapdragon X, Snapdragon X Plus, and Snapdragon X Elite. Battery life and AI capabilities are equivalent across all three, while CPU performance scales up. Qualcomm doesn\u0026#39;t have higher-powered configurations for serious video editors, gamers, and content creators, but they do all come with an NPU (Neural Processing Unit) capable of 45 TOPS (Trillions of Operations Per Second). When they initially launched, these Snapdragon laptops were the only devices that qualified as Copilot+ PCs, as they were the only laptops with the 45 TOPS NPU. These days, however, both Intel and AMD have earned the Copilot+ PC badge.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe major difference with the Snapdragon chips is the ARM architecture. These have been used in phone chips for many years, but Apple showed how they could scale up with the M-series of chips used in MacBooks, while keeping that impressive efficiency. Snapdragon X is the equivalent of that for Windows laptops, which finally delivers on both performance and battery life. Initially, there were concerns about app compatibility, which has been a problem with ARM adoption in the past. A year later, that\u0026#39;s mostly been resolved, with most major applications being compiled for ARM natively.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eAMD Processors\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile AMD is Intel\u0026#39;s primary competitor in desktop chips, the company has always had a hard time competing on a large scale in laptops.

Like Intel, you can tell you\u0026#39;re looking at the latest chips by the first number in the SKU. AMD uses similar nomenclature to Intel, including Ryzen 5, Ryzen 7, and Ryzen 9. AMD even uses similar family names like HX, H, and U series to indicate different performance and power envelopes. AMD has a couple of unique solutions this year, such as the Ryzen AI Max/Max+ chips, as seen in the  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/review/asus-rog-flow-z13-2025/' class='link'\u003eAsus ROG Flow Z13\u003c/a\u003e . These chips use an oversized integrated GPU chip, the Radeon 8060S, which has a whopping 40 GPU cores, effectively eliminating the need for a discrete GPU. Then, there\u0026#39;s the Ryzen 9 9955HX3D, which brings the successful 3D V-cache technology to a refreshed Ryzen 9000 chip for gaming laptops.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs you can see, gaming laptops have become a major emphasis for AMD, because it\u0026#39;s the one area where AMD has managed to win designs from Intel.

The M-series chips have been a huge hit since 2020, dramatically increasing performance and battery life. Fortunately, the designations are a bit simpler to parse through. The M4 family of chips for MacBooks is the latest release, including the base M4, M4 Pro, and M4 Max. The M4 is available on the 13-inch and  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/review/macbook-air-15-inch-2025/' class='link'\u003e15-inch MacBook Air,\u003c/a\u003e  as well as the 14-inch MacBook Pro. The M4 Pro and M4 Max are the only options for the MacBook Pro, dramatically increasing GPU performance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe older chips are important to know about, too, especially since you can still buy the M1 MacBook Air. You can also buy “renewed” or refurbished versions of older models, such as the M3 Pro or M2 Max MacBook Pro. While the generational bumps (from M3 to M4, for example) have provided consistent increases in CPU performance, it requires getting into very specific comparisons to know the difference between the M2 Max and M3 Pro, for example.

Most that we\u0026#39;ve tested have had Intel Core i3 or better, along with more memory, more storage, and better webcams than traditional Chromebooks. The good news is that these are not much more expensive than the older models.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt the other end of the spectrum, there are also an increasing number of Chromebooks with Qualcomm\u0026#39;s Snapdragon series chips, which offer a good compromise between power and price. We haven\u0026#39;t had a chance to test these extensively yet, but they should be a good addition to the lower-end Chromebook market, offering more power than Intel\u0026#39;s Celeron without the extra battery drain of Core-series processors.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe cheapest Chromebooks still use Intel\u0026#39;s Celeron series processors. If your needs are very minimal and you\u0026#39;ll never do anything more than lightly browse the web, the Celerons will do. But if you\u0026#39;re hoping to run Android apps or install Linux apps on your Chromebook, the Celeron processors will struggle and will likely frustrate you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003ch2 class='text-xl font-semibold'\u003eWhat About a Graphics Card?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cfigure class='AssetEmbedWrapper-eVDQiB byBkf asset-embed'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cpicture class='ResponsiveImagePicture-cWuUZO dUOtEa AssetEmbedResponsiveAsset-cXBNxi lqMXz asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image'\u003e\u003cimg src='https://media.wired.com/photos/67e5bd328eceed9f2cae96f3/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Razer-Blade-16-2025-Laptop-(front)-Reviewer-Photo-SOURCE-Luke-Larsen.jpg' alt='Front view of Razer Blade 16 2025 edition a slim black laptop with abstract art on the screen'\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003ePhotograph: Luke Larsen\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eAll laptops technically have graphics cards, but most are bundled into the motherboard with the processor. This approach, known as “integrated graphics,” is fine for most users. You’ll be able to watch movies and even play casual games without too much of an issue. Intel\u0026#39;s integrated graphics are currently the best, outdoing AMD and Qualcomm\u0026#39;s solutions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026#39;re a gamer or do a lot of video editing, though, you\u0026#39;ll want a laptop with a discrete graphics card—a separate and much more powerful graphics card.

Random-access memory, known as RAM, is what your laptop uses to hold data while the processor does things with it. Think of RAM as your desk. All the things you\u0026#39;re working on right now should be able to fit on your desk. If your desk is too small, things fall off and you can\u0026#39;t work on them. In the same way, if you run out of RAM, you won\u0026#39;t be able to open any more browser tabs or finish compiling your video. Eventually, your laptop will freeze up and need to be restarted.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the past, 8 GB of RAM was the standard. But in 2025, that standard has been moved up to 16 GB. On the Apple side, even the basic 13-inch MacBook Air starts at 16 GB of RAM. For Windows, 16 GB is the requirement for qualification as a Copilot+ PC, meaning laptops as cheap as $799 now come with 16 GB. Because of that, only budget laptops or Chromebooks should be considered with 8 GB (or less).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat\u0026#39;s just the minimum, though—32 GB is a great option for gamers or content creators who are willing to pay for the best performance. Or you can go higher; the highest-end MacBook Pro models now offer 128 GB of memory.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne thing to keep in mind is RAM expandability. Many laptops these days don\u0026#39;t allow you to upgrade or replace memory yourself. Unless you\u0026#39;re buying a  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/review/framework-laptop-13-amd-2025/' class='link'\u003eFramework Laptop\u003c/a\u003e , you\u0026#39;ll find that most now come soldered down. That means you\u0026#39;ll need to configure your laptop with the amount of RAM you actually need when you buy it. Some gaming laptops are among the rare few that sometimes allow you to upgrade the model or at least offer you a free slot to add a secondary stick of RAM.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eLastly, you\u0026#39;ll want to consider memory speed. Laptops you buy in 2025 will have either DDR4 or DDR5 RAM, also known as double data rate. You\u0026#39;ll often see this referred to as LPDDR5X, the mobile version of DDR5, made for laptops. This has become common for most of the refreshed premium laptops coming out in 2025. The next iteration, DDR6, is supposed to launch later this year, but it will likely take a while for it to roll out to laptops.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003ch2 class='text-xl font-semibold'\u003eHow Much Storage Do You Need?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cfigure class='AssetEmbedWrapper-eVDQiB byBkf asset-embed'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cpicture class='ResponsiveImagePicture-cWuUZO dUOtEa AssetEmbedResponsiveAsset-cXBNxi lqMXz asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image'\u003e\u003cimg src='https://media.wired.com/photos/6802e20568bf21be6e9c8d9b/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/frameworklaptop13_Inside_Photo-SOURCE-Luke-Larsen.jpg' alt='Image may contain Computer Electronics Laptop Pc Computer Hardware and Hardware'\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003ePhotograph: Luke Larsen\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe hard drive is where you\u0026#39;ll store all your data. Think of this as the filing cabinet next to your desk. Nearly every laptop you can buy these days comes with an NVMe solid-state drive (SSD), which is nothing like the old-school spinning drives of many years ago.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut how much storage do you need? It\u0026#39;s a good question, and it will probably depend on each person. If you primarily use cloud storage and don\u0026#39;t need many local applications installed, 256 GB of storage might suit you just fine. Outside of Chromebooks, it\u0026#39;s very rare to find laptops with storage capacity as low as 128 GB these days.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you plan to deal with lots of local files or have lots of games installed, you\u0026#39;ll want at least 512 GB of storage. For high-end gaming laptops, for example, 1 TB has become the standard, such as on the  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/review/razer-blade-16-2025/' class='link'\u003eRazer Blade 16\u003c/a\u003e .\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026#39;re shopping for a budget laptop, you may run across eMMC storage. This is still billed as an SSD (which it is), but it\u0026#39;s a little different than the NVMe and PCIe SSDs. The abbreviation stands for Embedded MultiMediaCard, and it\u0026#39;s what you\u0026#39;ll find in phones, tablets, and some laptops (especially Chromebooks). However, the \u0026#34;embedded\u0026#34; in eMMC usually means it\u0026#39;s soldered directly onto the motherboard. In other words, you can\u0026#39;t swap in a larger drive down the road. The other disadvantage is slower speeds.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe minimum amount of space we recommend is 256 GB. If you store everything in the cloud or are looking at Chromebooks, you might be able to get by with less, but it\u0026#39;s good to have the space if you ever need it. If you plan to install games, software, or save a lot of photos or videos, that will quickly eat up space. If you need more space, see our  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/best-portable-external-storage-drives/' class='link'\u003eBest Portable SSDs\u003c/a\u003e  guide for some external and internal expansion options.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou may have noticed that your hard drive doesn\u0026#39;t seem to ever have its advertised space. If a hard drive is labeled 512 GB, it may show as having only 490 GB available in Windows. You aren\u0026#39;t losing space; this just has to do with the difference between binary and decimal byte size calculations. The drive makers use decimal bytes, but Windows uses binary, which is why they report different sizes. They are both technically correct, though the size Windows reports is the amount of disk space you can use to store files.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003ch2 class='text-xl font-semibold'\u003eWhat Kind of Screen Should You Get?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cfigure class='AssetEmbedWrapper-eVDQiB byBkf asset-embed'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cpicture class='ResponsiveImagePicture-cWuUZO dUOtEa AssetEmbedResponsiveAsset-cXBNxi lqMXz asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image'\u003e\u003cimg src='https://media.wired.com/photos/68265e07249147cd55667552/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Microsoft-Surface-Pro-12_Front-Side-View_Photo-SOURCE-Luke-Larsen.jpg' alt='Image may contain Computer Electronics Tablet Computer Laptop Pc Surface Computer and Computer Hardware'\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003ePhotograph: Luke Larsen\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe best place to start here is screen size, since that determines how big of a laptop you\u0026#39;re getting. In many cases, it also determines the amount of performance you can get out of the laptop. The three most common sizes for laptops are 13-inch, 14-inch, and 16-inch.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMost laptop buyers should start with the 14-inch size, as it\u0026#39;s a great compromise between portability, screen real estate, and performance. Some 14-inch laptops can have powerful discrete GPUs, such as the  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/review/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14/' class='link'\u003eROG Zephyrus G14\u003c/a\u003e , while others are impressively thin.

Sharpness is the next aspect of the screen to consider. Due to the 16:10 aspect ratio, 2560 x 1600 is the default resolution for premium 13-inch or 14-inch laptops. That\u0026#39;s true of the MacBook Air, as well as many gaming laptops, providing a high enough pixel density so that you can\u0026#39;t see individual pixels. I recommend buying a 15-inch or 16-inch laptop with at least this resolution, while 1920 x 1200 is good enough for more budget-minded 13-inch or 14-inch laptops. There are, of course, higher-resolution laptops out there, too, which are especially good for larger screens.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe next thing to consider is your screen\u0026#39;s capabilities. For example, touchscreens will add to the cost, but they can be very useful if you want to sketch on your laptop or take handwritten notes. The  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/high-refresh-rate-explained/' class='link'\u003erefresh rate\u003c/a\u003e  has also become an important feature. Budget laptops are at 60-Hz, but increasingly, we\u0026#39;re seeing 75, 90, or 120 Hz as the new standard for average premium laptops. Gaming laptops take this to the extreme, with refresh rates up to 240, 360, or even 500 Hz.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe have to talk about the panels themselves. IPS LCD is the standard, but next-generation panels like Mini-LED or OLED are increasingly common. Mini-LED can get much brighter than IPS, such as the MacBook Pro, which can range up to 1,200 nits of peak HDR brightness. OLED panels are readily available in Windows laptops, which don\u0026#39;t get as bright in SDR as Mini-LED but have the deep blacks that only OLED can produce, making it great for HDR.

This part is hard to test if you\u0026#39;re buying over the internet. If possible, head to a local store like Best Buy so you can hold the model you\u0026#39;re interested in. Try opening it with one hand. That might sound silly, but trust me, not being able to open your laptop with one hand is annoying.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou should also consider the keyboard and trackpad quality. While keyboard quality is fairly consistent across laptops, trackpads can vary wildly.

Laptop audio is usually awful. Most laptops have a very basic set of 5-watt stereo speakers, but four-speaker setups provide a richer, fuller sound.

Unlike a traditional broadcast, YouTube allows Schuster to go live before there’s a tornado warning, so he can warn viewers if a storm is likely to produce a tornado. When Hurricane Milton hit Florida last year, causing a tornado outbreak, Schuster said he heard from a viewer that his livestream prompted their family members to seek shelter. “Our weather coverage is actually saving lives,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSchuster expects the storm-streaming world to get more crowded. He notes that competition has recently heated up between them. “It\u0026#39;s bound to happen, but he wanted to make this more of a competition on YouTube,” he says. “We\u0026#39;re definitely not as close as I thought we were.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 class='text-xl font-semibold'\u003eNational Weather Service Cuts\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eTraditional forecasters, storm streamers, and even Y’all Bot rely heavily on the National Weather Service; the agency is a primary source that runs radar sites, launches weather balloons, and flies planes into hurricanes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCuts across the National Weather Service are making storm streamers nervous. The NWS  \u003ca href='https://www.weather.gov/ilx/ua-tour' class='link'\u003eweather balloon launches\u003c/a\u003e  collect valuable information on temperature, humidity, pressure, and winds. “Because there\u0026#39;s been a lack of balloon launches, the data that\u0026#39;s getting fed into these models just haven\u0026#39;t been as good as they could have been,” Beacham said. Fewer planes flying into hurricanes will mean less accurate forecasts of where hurricanes will make landfall, Schuster said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJana Houser, a storm chaser and meteorology professor at Ohio State University, says the understaffing at the National Weather Service office in Jackson, Kentucky, during deadly tornadoes was “a small glimpse of what’s to come.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“The office did as good of a job as they could have possibly done, but they didn\u0026#39;t have the resources that they could have possibly had in a different climate,” Houser says. “Unless we get full staffing in, there are going to be tired forecasters. There are going to be overworked people. There are going to be missed tornadoes.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHouser said streamers like Hall are providing a public service. “He is helping to inform the general public, which is a service, especially under the context of a poorly funded and resource-starved National Weather Service.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut she adds that storm streamers can misread the radar and raise the alarm about a cloud formation that is not capable of producing a tornado. This is problematic if there’s conflicting information between a streamer and the NWS. “It can create a sense of distrust or confusion,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHill said his team is “immensely careful,” but it’s impossible to perfectly forecast tornadoes, and they do make mistakes. Calling tornadoes before the National Weather Service means they have a higher false-alarm rate than the federal agency, Hill said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“There\u0026#39;s a lot of layers there to justify before [the NWS] sends out a warning. So their false-alarm rate is going to be much lower than ours,” Hill said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 class='text-xl font-semibold'\u003eClimate Change Conundrum\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eHurricanes are becoming more frequent as global heating cooks the planet, but you wouldn’t know it by watching the storm streamers.

But he argues that his approach is more likely to make climate skeptics curious instead of defensive. “Especially in those deep red states, there\u0026#39;s plenty of people who are still on the fence,” he says.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“It\u0026#39;s going to be a long-term thing, but it\u0026#39;s going to be something I work on my whole life,” Hill says.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the immediate future, the storm streamers are facing a busy hurricane season this year, and their audiences will likely continue to grow.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBeacham predicted that people will soon create AI bots that can read radar and livestream personalized weather forecasts.

sophisticated bean-to-cup machine from Italian coffee titan De\u0026#39;Longhi ( \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/review/delonghi-rivelia-espresso-machine/' class='link'\u003e7/10, WIRED Recommends\u003c/a\u003e ) immediately ranks among the most modern, impressive, and capable superautomatic espresso machines I\u0026#39;ve encountered—the sort that has you dump a half-bag of beans into a hopper and will grind, brew, then froth up milk for a flat white, amid 18 options on espresso, latte, cappuccino, and iced-coffee drink options.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePretty much everything operates via an easy touchscreen, including bean guidance that lets you optimize the machine for each bean. The milk frother works at the press of a button and makes actual microfoam—and the foam\u0026#39;s density can be adjusted to make frothier cappuccino or dense flat white. It\u0026#39;s so easy I let my parents test-drive it, and they fell in love with it within a day. If you\u0026#39;ve got multiple people using the machine, you can save multiple profiles and your favorite custom drinks. So Dad can have his basic “coffee” that\u0026#39;s actually a European-style café crema, and Mom can have her ridiculously large 16-ounce travel-mug latte. (Yes, these are their drinks.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat\u0026#39;s better, the Rivelia has two swappable bean hoppers so it\u0026#39;s easy to swap between caff and decaf, or between light and dark roasts. Honestly, this is the bean-to-cup espresso machine that fully sold me on the idea of automatic coffee machines like this one. Though note: Fully automatic espresso machines like the Rivelia grind a little coarser, in order to make espresso less finicky and less difficult. This leads to a smoother but less nuanced profile than espresso shots you\u0026#39;d find in a café. But if you\u0026#39;re a milk lover, the absolute ease with which the Rivelia froths a cappuccino will likely balance this out. The cold espresso is also a pleasant option when mixed with milk or vodka.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003ch2 class='text-xl font-semibold'\u003eBest All-in-One Espresso Machine for

WIRED contributing reviewer Tyler Shane was skeptical about Ninja\u0026#39;s first foray into the latte and cappuccino world with the Luxe Cafe Premier ( \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/review/luxe-cafe-premier-series-automatic-espresso-machine/' class='link'\u003e7/10, WIRED Recommends\u003c/a\u003e ), especially since the machine also promised cold brew and even traditional drip coffee. But she came away impressed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis Ninja is not a superautomatic machine like our top automated pick, the Rivelia. It\u0026#39;s what the industry likes to call “semiautomatic.” Semiautomatic espresso machines offer a built-in grinder and automatic milk frother, but still uses a non-pressurized portafilter that will pull a classic espresso shot with full nuance and aromatics. In our espresso maker guide, we recommend the ever-reliable and terrific  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-espresso-machines/' class='link'\u003eBreville Barista Express ($750)\u003c/a\u003e  as WIRED\u0026#39;s favorite accessibly priced semiautomatic.

Depending on your chosen drink, the Ninja Luxe will recommend the appropriate grind size on its display screen and help you dial it in. (This may take a couple tries.) Milk frothing is easy, and the automatic milk frothing is shockingly good. Plus, you can froth cold foam, for silly cold-foam drinks. See what I mean? Ninja is fun.

Why? Because it sits so nicely at a comfortable intersection where ease of use meets automation and affordability. This is about the lowest-priced machine you can ever expect to find with automatic milk frothing at the press of a single button, with options of late foam or cappuccino froth. Just load fine-ground coffee into the portafilter, tamp it down, and twist it on. The machine will mix up a cappuccino or a latte macchiato at the press of a button.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis machine has a forgiving (but not overly intense or nuanced) pressurized portafiter, which means it will work with almost any “espresso-grind” coffee from your local café or the grocery store.

The Affetto features a built-in steaming wand, produces 20 bars of pump pressure to ensure your espresso is fully extracted, and is a slick little machine. It\u0026#39;s very slim and fits comfortably on a small apartment countertop without having to rearrange everything. Because coffee production is automated, you just need to fill the water tank and put whole beans in the hopper, and you\u0026#39;re good to go. You can brew one or two shots with just the press of a button, and there\u0026#39;s a programmable button to create your favorite drinks (like an Americano with  \u003cem class='italic'\u003ejust\u003c/em\u003e  the right amount of water).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe milk frother does a lot of the work on its own. Just pour some of your favorite milk into the frothing pitcher, submerge the wand, and hit the steam button. If you\u0026#39;re new to frothing milk, you don\u0026#39;t even need to move the pitcher to produce a creamy and consistent microfoam. We tested the frother with dairy milk, oat milk, and soy milk. It produced soft and creamy café-grade froth each time. Just make sure it\u0026#39;s topped up with water and beans and that you clean out the spent grounds container regularly, and it works like a dream. — \u003cem class='italic'\u003eJaina

Breville Oracle Jet ( \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/review/breville-oracle-jet/' class='link'\u003e8/10, WIRED Recommends\u003c/a\u003e ) is my favorite of the seven new espresso machines I\u0026#39;ve tried so far this year. It\u0026#39;s the one I recommend as my top pick in WIRED\u0026#39;s guide to the  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-espresso-machines/' class='link'\u003eBest Espresso Machines\u003c/a\u003e , over other estimable contenders from Breville that include the  \u003ca href='https://www.amazon.com/Breville-BES880BSS-Barista-Espresso-Stainless/dp/B078WMLXXG/' class='link'\u003eBarista Touch ($1,000)\u003c/a\u003e  and the  \u003ca href='https://cna.st/affiliate-link/731Y1jnnp3aqDjbWMHpb21W2THJEgzmMuyHUSu9LyEamb2ekg6g8Km9QSgfKLdbYgtEVag7euEyrijonGoWZ2MoKTkyY8d9uMRKg5Q66cgDH4PYYARXYMoC5eVzhtMZuJJ593JzwiK1YsdV5eEZ8AvQDbkAigUaPMRbVBwPR6F3VcacpSS52jkjvFeaU5RCBRjaH2XwS19xAJ' class='link'\u003eBarista Pro ($849)\u003c/a\u003e . And it\u0026#39;s the one that best mixes full-flavored, nuanced espresso with the ease of machine-guided, touchscreen operation. It\u0026#39;s versatile, it\u0026#39;s powerful, its PID controller means the temperature is quite stable, and it makes absolutely lovely cups—espresso that\u0026#39;s denser and more intensely aromatic than the coffee made by any other machine on this list, whether in bringing out the fruity berry notes in an anaerobic light roast, or the dark chocolate of a roasty Italian.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the finicky, often difficult world of classic home espresso machines, the Oracle Jet is a paragon of simplicity and machine-guided brewing: It\u0026#39;s a miracle that one can so easily pull such delicious and nuanced shots, that remain so sensitive to the character of each bean. But that sensitivity still makes the Oracle Jet a little more finicky than other machines on this list. And while the automatic milk frothing is quite good, it\u0026#39;s not as failsafe as our favorites here. (I still like steaming milk manually on the Breville, versus using the auto-froth.) But if you want espresso that will distill he beauteous character of fresh-roasted beans but still don\u0026#39;t want to try overly hard—on a machine whose intuitive touchscreen tutorial will guide you to lovely flat whites and capps? This is your huckleberry.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003ch2 class='text-xl font-semibold'\u003eBest Pod Latte and Cappuccino Machine\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003ca href='https://cna.st/p/iqZ9y5iK3WikqF64Z6iaV1PFzGdy6wr1EVtcQn3v6NTwsimYy53i7kLZN1QhWZcoqY6iuHLJt9wTsub4cxQdUt1D95v5Hzivhdi5Nbkcq8Wbe8sa2dDc46BBDXkJLqSVWvBpzoKqiC32fZc5sJyVERDFvjRT9XWFAw5dkaHjNEc73JBB5rGG7aZEJEPrRTV8DrzfNd76AmdKzvj4XFy9o8AmmXPazu7M9tM8uKEtzLNc89wr6UirUQvzEzNY5JWbEvsN7Nus6ArXXnTFnmusyPWUE' class='link'\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cpicture class='ResponsiveImagePicture-cWuUZO dUOtEa responsive-image'\u003e\u003cimg src='https://media.wired.com/photos/5b7e097e5560bb1fedf11d5b/4:3/w_748%2Cc_limit/Keurig_Special-Edition-K-Cafe-Single-Serve-Coffee%2C-Latte-and-Cappuccino-Maker-SOURCE-Keurig.jpg' alt='Keurig Special Edition K Cafe Single Serve Coffee and Espresso Maker'\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003ePhotograph: Keurig\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eKeurig\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003ch3 class='text-xl font-medium'\u003eK-Café\u003c/h3\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003ca href='https://cna.st/p/iqZ9y5iK3WikqF64Z6iaV1PFzGdy6wr1EVtcQn3v6NTwsimYy53i7kLZN1QhWZcoqY6iuHLJt9wTsub4cxQdUt1D95v5Hzivhdi5Nbkcq8Wbe8sa2dDc46BBDXkJLqSVWvBpzoKqiC32fZc5sJyVERDFvjRT9XWFAw5dkaHjNEc73JBB5rGG7aZEJEPrRTV8DrzfNd76AmdKzvj4XFy9o8AmmXPazu7M9tM8uKEtzLNc89wr6UirUQvzEzNY5JWbEvsN7Nus6ArXXnTFnmusyPWUE' class='link'\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan\u003e$200\u003c/span\u003e \u003cp\u003eAmazon\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003ca href='https://cna.st/p/4NeJabgQykde13qrmPRuhidu9SxXHSLRy4sba59DzJ8w8H9SMXbinJgihfR2RN8oPEZWR6BfMtzf4Bfeb1wW8V6DYGo1yRn3hcByAp2Z7j5HRdLEMJBoJcE7EUdaDY98tpX8J8qWfNhsotvd7FUUU6W1udCnJhw2vmNCcqyEsAANx79S2htmwT1QktT121eAuqjwBa596mSLnDywTrgnEg6mApS6BZw3w2dAdRxLQiKV7jb9fCXkkkD49n1L2skHNFMrUSxgFsnTUYgXXhLVELL6KKfubCiukD884zu6GVtG6Yccun7EiaKfq1WeMbfsojSf5jCeqfLjMUiu4S2D296jKoqhzLeb1G' class='link'\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan\u003e$220\u003c/span\u003e \u003cp\u003eTarget\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eFormer WIRED reviewer Jaina Grey loved this machine. It\u0026#39;s the best Keurig that Grey ever used ( \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/review/review-keurig-k-cafe/' class='link'\u003e8/10, WIRED Recommends\u003c/a\u003e ), but it especially offers a terrific frother. (Though check out our updated  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-pod-coffee-makers/' class='link'\u003epod coffee maker guide\u003c/a\u003e  for more recommendations.) This K-Café doesn’t technically make espresso shots, because grounds aren\u0026#39;t pulled under pressure. But it does make a delicious 2-ounce “espresso style” shot that can taste almost as strong. So why is it in this guide? The frother. It has three settings—cold, latte, and cappuccino—and it\u0026#39;ll froth milk to perfection with the tap of a button, ready to be poured from the stainless steel carafe. It\u0026#39;s a latte maker that\u0026#39;s simple to use and easy to clean—and the milk is so beautifully foamed that it\u0026#39;s tempting to use this device to froth milk for espresso made on other machines.\u003c/p\u003e\u003chr class='my-4 border-t border-gray-300'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003ch2 class='text-xl font-semibold'\u003eBest Handheld Milk Frother\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003ca href='https://cna.st/p/aokKbRGiuxPAtmyAwGZUVb9JG8pzXohGhHuj9M8uZsva5eQ9ueJS3ALGaUJYV3sQrUAx33npmiL6nMqJYaLvY4XMCVLCYUr5EnXuLtKPN8oU8qVgz96WZAy66u7DAZoCRxG9XmZrTRGPnxcJh2BArUSG1pz3GP4v6B9UfT1YBjyyqBWWxnsC9ai9De7tknkYY5nBKCDiHGJvpW3Fcv6FhEGkBYBxtLX4DtrnTp1Wv3svWto17T8M3GhPHwDWKd35SwM3VbCcfVAhqE6hhpbyYKEDyQ7iLpn1EuT8UUgM69HpT2AsnhC' class='link'\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cpicture class='ResponsiveImagePicture-cWuUZO dUOtEa responsive-image'\u003e\u003cimg src='https://media.wired.com/photos/68467a3e6a8d54560e2c60b5/4:3/w_748%2Cc_limit/41LUQmdhgqL._SL500_.jpg' alt='Image may contain: Cup, Beverage, Coffee, Coffee Cup, Tape, and Electronics'\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eSubminimal\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003ch3 class='text-xl font-medium'\u003eNanofoamer\u003c/h3\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003ca href='https://cna.st/p/aokKbRGiuxPAtmyAwGZUVb9JG8pzXohGhHuj9M8uZsva5eQ9ueJS3ALGaUJYV3sQrUAx33npmiL6nMqJYaLvY4XMCVLCYUr5EnXuLtKPN8oU8qVgz96WZAy66u7DAZoCRxG9XmZrTRGPnxcJh2BArUSG1pz3GP4v6B9UfT1YBjyyqBWWxnsC9ai9De7tknkYY5nBKCDiHGJvpW3Fcv6FhEGkBYBxtLX4DtrnTp1Wv3svWto17T8M3GhPHwDWKd35SwM3VbCcfVAhqE6hhpbyYKEDyQ7iLpn1EuT8UUgM69HpT2AsnhC' class='link'\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan\u003e$57\u003c/span\u003e \u003cp\u003eAmazon\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eSometimes making a whole latte or cappuccino using an automated machine can be a time suck.

As with other high-ened De\u0026#39;Longhi devices of the moment, the milk frother is truly impressive, offering seriously luxurious frothed milk. Milk-based recipes at the touch of a button are a latte macchiato and cappuccino, while espresso and Americanos are the espresso-based options. There’s a slot for ground beans and a hopper for whole beans. Figureing out grind size takes a little trial and error, Shane noted, and it\u0026#39;s not an overly quiet machine. But the Start is compact and efficient, and priced far lower than our favorite De\u0026#39;Longhi automatic, the Rivelia.

Plug your city or region and “locally roasted coffee beans” into Google and you will be glad you did. The reason that your locally roasted coffee will taste worlds better than anything you\u0026#39;d buy from a major coffee roaster (like Starbucks, Illy, or Gevalia) is simple: Good coffee starts to lose flavor the moment it\u0026#39;s roasted. Get it fresh and you\u0026#39;re giving yourself a much better chance at high-quality espresso.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWant some help finding the best roasters?

Unless you see a roasting date on the bag, you probably have no idea when the roaster actually roasted it. If the roaster is a French or Italian brand, there\u0026#39;s a good chance it was months ago. Coffee is best when it\u0026#39;s fresh, ideally brewed a week or two after it\u0026#39;s roasted. And grinding the beans dramatically increases the rate at which coffee degrades. This doesn\u0026#39;t just affect how the coffee tastes. It affects how well the espresso maker will push water through the beans, leading to possible blowouts or bad extraction.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you haven’t made espresso before, and you don\u0026#39;t have access to a coffee grinder, we recommend you buy locally roasted beans.

Machines may never understand what it’s like to be conscious, she said, and trying to hard-code human preferences into future systems may be shortsighted. Instead, she proposed a lofty-sounding idea called “cosmic alignment”—building AI that can seek out deeper, more universal values we haven’t yet discovered.

A philosopher named  \u003ca href='https://x.com/johnsonmxe?lang=en' class='link'\u003eMichael Edward Johnson\u003c/a\u003e  took the mic and argued that we all have an intuition that radical technological change is imminent, but we lack a principled framework for dealing with the shift—especially as it relates to human values. He said that if consciousness is “the home of value,” then building AI without fully understanding consciousness is a dangerous gamble. We risk either enslaving something that can suffer or trusting something that can’t. (This idea relies on a similar premise to machine consciousness and is also hotly debated.) Rather than forcing AI to follow human commands forever, he proposed a more ambitious goal: teaching both humans and our machines to pursue “the good.” (He didn’t share a precise definition of what “the good” is, but he insists it isn’t mystical and hopes it can be defined scientifically.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure class='AssetEmbedWrapper-eVDQiB byBkf asset-embed callout--group-item callout--group-item-1'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cpicture class='ResponsiveImagePicture-cWuUZO dUOtEa AssetEmbedResponsiveAsset-cXBNxi lqMXz asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image'\u003e\u003cimg src='https://media.wired.com/photos/6848a030f1fa175f4fca7e70/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Party-at-the-End-of-World-Business-IMG_6435.jpg' alt='Image may contain Angelo Branduardi Lamp Crowd Person Adult People Audience Clothing Footwear Shoe and Speech'\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cp\u003ePhilosopher Michael Edward Johnson\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003ePhotograph: Kylie Robison\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cfigure class='AssetEmbedWrapper-eVDQiB byBkf asset-embed callout--group-item callout--group-item-2'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cpicture class='ResponsiveImagePicture-cWuUZO dUOtEa AssetEmbedResponsiveAsset-cXBNxi lqMXz asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image'\u003e\u003cimg src='https://media.wired.com/photos/6848a0693c4782ab381c8b32/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Party-at-the-End-of-World-Business-IMG_6440.jpg' alt='Image may contain Lamp Book Publication Indoors Interior Design Adult Person Furniture Table and Electrical Device'\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cp\u003eEntrepreneur and speaker Daniel Faggella\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003ePhotograph: Kylie Robison\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eFinally, Faggella took the stage. He believes humanity won’t last forever in its current form and that we have a responsibility to design a successor, not just one that survives but one that can create new kinds of meaning and value. He pointed to two traits this successor must have: consciousness and “autopoiesis,” the ability to evolve and generate new experiences. Citing philosophers like Baruch Spinoza and Friedrich Nietzsche, he argued that most value in the universe is still undiscovered and that our job is not to cling to the old but to build something capable of uncovering what comes next.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis, he said, is the heart of what he calls “axiological cosmism,” a worldview where the purpose of intelligence is to expand the space of what’s possible and valuable rather than merely serve human needs. He warned that the AGI race today is reckless and that humanity may not be ready for what it\u0026#39;s building. But if we do it right, he said, AI won’t just inherit the Earth—it might inherit the universe’s potential for meaning itself.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDuring a break between panels and the Q\u0026amp;A, clusters of guests debated topics like the AI race between the US and China.

lock might look like it\u0026#39;s a full lock replacement, but this is a retrofit design that only changes out the back of your thumb-turn dead bolt. That means your existing keys will still work, and everyone outside of your house will have no idea that it\u0026#39;s smart. It\u0026#39;s ideal for renters, but also nice for anyone who doesn\u0026#39;t want to switch out their front lock and swap keys. All of that also means installation was fast and easy—the hardest part is keeping your existing lock from falling to the ground while you swap out the backing, but it only takes a few minutes to complete.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs its name suggests, the Yale Approach Lock ( \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/review/yale-approach-lock-review/' class='link'\u003e8/10, WIRED Recommends\u003c/a\u003e ) can sense when you approach. It uses your phone\u0026#39;s location to do this, and within the app, you place a small range to establish what counts as you “arriving” home. I have a patio and a small staircase between my door and my car, so I made a larger range that could sense me once I hit the staircase. That worked better than placing the range in the center of my home, since it wouldn\u0026#39;t count me as arriving until I was already at the door.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eYale\u0026#39;s parent company, Assa Abloy,  \u003ca href='https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/19/16502790/august-home-acquisition-assa-abloy' class='link'\u003eacquired smart-lock\u003c/a\u003e  brand August back in 2017, and if you\u0026#39;ve ever used an August lock before, then the included Wi-Fi bridge will look familiar.

affordable, without looking like there was a budget lock on my front door. Unlike the Yale Approach above, this is a full deadbolt replacement lock, replacing both the front and back pieces of a deadbolt on your front door. It\u0026#39;s easy to install, and is one of the fastest installations I\u0026#39;ve done. It was even fast to remove, and then put back onto my door after the next lock I set up didn\u0026#39;t work. It does have some tiny screws you\u0026#39;ll want a precision screwdriver for.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe U50\u0026#39;s sleek panel blended in nicely with my door, was consistently responsive, and had a high-end feel to it that felt more expensive than the price tag. This lock previously wasn\u0026#39;t a pick because you needed Aqara\u0026#39;s expensive hubs to connect it to Wi-Fi, and often retails for more than the lock itself.

I also usually needed a Bluetooth connection to do anything serious, even when the Wi-Fi was working. Still, even if Wi-Fi wasn\u0026#39;t working right, the pre-made codes always worked and it always remembered to lock itself after 10 minutes. It also knows whether the door is closed or not thanks to a built-in gyroscope—no separate door accessory required, which most other locks need to do the same feature.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis lock has a nice range of entry options beyond the keypad, including smart home control (including Apple Home), NFC cards (if you already have one), and even a hidden keyhole, with two keys included with the lock.

Not only does the Visage have a fingerprint reader, but it has built-in sensors to recognize your face to unlock the door as you walk up. That\u0026#39;s right, this lock can see you coming.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen installing this lock, I recommend moving fast when you get to the battery stage. Don\u0026#39;t put in the rechargeable battery until you\u0026#39;ve downloaded the app, located the activation card inside the box (keep this safe in case you ever reset the lock), and are prepared to finish the in-app setup steps, specifically the Visage ID—Lockly\u0026#39;s face-recognition tech. The battery activates a Bluetooth signal that was only live for a few minutes in my testing, and you\u0026#39;ll need to input the code and finish the steps in that amount of time. Restarting it over and over is frustrating, but possible. Lockly says it has pushed an update to fix this short-lived Bluetooth window, but I\u0026#39;d still plan to be ready to roll once you put in the battery.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eOnce set up, I had zero connection issues and was happy with how quickly this lock could recognize my face as I walked up (even with sunglasses on!) or how quickly it could read my fingerprint. The Visage uses infrared (IR) sensors and a camera to see when a person is approaching and who they are. The sensors in the lock have both live-body detection and face recognition, so it isn\u0026#39;t spoofed by pictures. The infrared sensors have about a 2.6-foot range, and I did find that to feel accurate in my tests. The company promises no stills are captured, and the live face-tracking data is encrypted and is saved on-device. It\u0026#39;s nice to have both the face and fingerprint options, so members of your household can choose whatever they prefer.

The company sent me the Next Gen Smart Lock to try, which I’ve used for over a year and has functioned almost flawlessly in that time. Seriously, I\u0026#39;ve only recharged the USB-C battery once in that time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFair warning, the instructions are complicated. You  \u003cem class='italic'\u003emay\u003c/em\u003e  be able to do it yourself, but I could not. The Connected Shop\u0026#39;s technician had to cut a part of the strike plate on my existing hardware to get it to latch. He also had to drill new holes into my sliding door frame, and in the process, he accidentally shattered the glass in the door. Welp! A representative says if it happened to a customer, the company would take care of it and replace the glass as it did mine. I highly recommend contacting the company and sending a picture of your lock if you have concerns about door compatibility.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOnce installed, you may find yourself, as I did, riffling through the manual to initially set up users, codes, fingerprints, and the app connectivity. (The manual is needlessly complicated.) That process involves inputting a code, then pressing the right numbers to get to the settings you need. There’s no real need to connect it to the third-party Tuya Smart app ( \u003ca href='https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tuya.smart\u0026hl=en_US' class='link'\u003eAndroid\u003c/a\u003e ,  \u003ca href='https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tuya-smart/id1034649547' class='link'\u003eiOS\u003c/a\u003e ), because, annoyingly, you can’t set up codes, fingerprints, or users in the app. It’s mostly for deleting members, creating temporary passwords, and seeing unlock or doorbell notifications. It’s also where you can view battery life. (The company says you can remotely unlock over Wi-Fi in the app, but this only works when someone rings the doorbell, which is a little bizarre.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere’s a lock and unlock button on the inside of the door, along with a manual knob, and a removable battery with a USB-C port for charging (again, I roughly have nine months on a single charge), though this will depend on how frequently you use your sliding glass door. It\u0026#39;s how I get to my backyard, so I do not use it as often as my front door. There is no handle, so I slide my door by pushing the side of the lock, which juts out from the door frame.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn the other end, you tap anywhere in the middle to have the number pad light up. There’s a doorbell function, though it’s hard to hear if you’re not in the lock\u0026#39;s vicinity. Just type in the code and press the unlock button, and that’s it. I predominantly use the fingerprint unlock, which works reliably once you get used to placing your finger on the sensor in a particular way. The Connected Shop also throws in two NFC tags—I leave one on my keychain—as a backup unlocking method, and there are two physical keys just in case (I have never used them).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe only thing that  \u003cem class='italic'\u003ehas\u003c/em\u003e  not worked is the company’s so-called Face Unlock.

(The people I interacted with were nice, but I’m also reviewing the company, so of course they were nice.)

I first began with the Bolt Fingerprint, which has been the most reliable of all the Ultraloq smart locks so far. If you have a standard door with a borehole for the dead bolt, it\u0026#39;ll be quick to install ( \u003ca href='https://cna.st/affiliate-link/9wuTcQB4CMStrGua4nazFqX39882ZSgXyLcHCt85nKZEfgoiJComESeQGDjH3prS8dg4PMPjdLzan1R6qpZBMoZ3cWFRdyhdKjZjpCwqoQdFVFzbZ2Yw3vumeausTErZ1hC3kPZd4onf3WjqU4JfRVciiMV1jfTqV7zzbjKAoPMPxsbqxZvkH9aKm1fNbuUmkxYiasWw7eVTkEmxS' class='link'\u003eUltraloq has a Thick Door Kit\u003c/a\u003e ). I initially had several issues getting the lock to connect to my Wi-Fi, but after multiple attempts and a few choice words, it connected. I’ve had no connectivity problems since. The app isn’t the prettiest, but it’s functional. You can add multiple user profiles, remotely unlock, get notifications when the doors are unlocked, share codes, and register fingerprints. There’s even an auto-unlock function for when you walk up to the door, but I found it a little inconsistent and left it turned off. The fingerprint sensor is the highlight after all. You have to get used to placing your finger on the sensor a specific way, and after doing this a few times, I’ve now got it down so that I almost always unlock on the first try. It comes with a door sensor, so when the door closes, it will automatically lock (you can disable this if you want). The next lock I tested was the  \u003ca href='https://cna.st/affiliate-link/32ZjHBEcANQ5x7mzLSHJxUJgTJvhgXHfHPZv4bh7yVDjyLtpRHirtz1mh9mvmeCdXZB7hUWXReCkNLSdve61hiqJVL3pTu5ZQUehSpHLzbF96SrrDw24MLqMmV7i1zEjzsSAodXRFpeLaxpEoKmQmQLpKHKauUJuqQ9mEZvD8w4Zzugi6hMNv2ttr1NcGao1E4P9crTspDgo3ZfC' class='link'\u003eUltraloq Bolt Fingerprint with Wi-Fi and HomeKit\u003c/a\u003e . This one did a better job connecting to my home\u0026#39;s Wi-Fi network through the U-Home app and was even quick to add to my Google Home. Unfortunately, after several months of flawless performance, one day it decided to start rejecting my fingerprint. The problem? When I put my fingerprint on the scanner, it denied it and then blocked all other methods of unlocking except the app (or the physical key that\u0026#39;s included). This was so annoying that I just stuck to using a numerical code with the keypad. Finally, I recently switched to the  \u003ca href='https://www.amazon.com/ULTRALOQ-Fingerprint-Biometric-Automation-Waterproof/dp/B0F1928BX1' class='link'\u003eBolt Fingerprint With Matter\u003c/a\u003e , and let\u0026#39;s just say I\u0026#39;m still diagnosing issues with the company. The lock decides to stop working after a few hours, forcing me to remove one of the batteries and put it back in to “reactivate” it. I might just have a defective unit, so we\u0026#39;ll see. — \u003cem class='italic'\u003eJulian Chokkattu\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure class='AssetEmbedWrapper-eVDQiB byBkf asset-embed'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cpicture class='ResponsiveImagePicture-cWuUZO dUOtEa AssetEmbedResponsiveAsset-cXBNxi lqMXz asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image'\u003e\u003cimg src='https://media.wired.com/photos/684ccc52fe7aff49d50c5749/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Source%2520Nena%2520Farrellz.png' alt='Image may contain Electronics Mobile Phone and Phone'\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003ePhotograph: Nena Farrell\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003e\u003ca href='https://cna.st/affiliate-link/KZVo18qecfVo5jYN8qy7WP4yEA4CV4HfeTFX71jHudaaRieqALFJBGf32GsSg9p3CTFUAhqHXa1it6mWXDTVFyinZcw8Be6h5vDAf8iYEXspVEij17fG3cb6bNZqiGzuGTciVa5wjXces21wGi' class='link'\u003eYale Assure Lock 2 Touch for $280\u003c/a\u003e:\u003c/strong\u003e  I\u0026#39;ve been testing this lock for a few weeks in tandem with ADT\u0026#39;s security system and Google Home. Unlike the other locks in this guide, I didn\u0026#39;t install it—an ADT tech did, and installation can be included in an ADT security package like the one I\u0026#39;ve been testing. For the lock itself, it\u0026#39;s worked well. It\u0026#39;s a full deadbolt replacement, and came with a single key, and has both a keypad and fingerprint reader for entry options. The fingerprint reader is speedy and efficient, and my husband says the keypad has been easy to use (you activate the keypad by touching the Yale button, but if your finger is registered to the app, that\u0026#39;s also the fingerprint reader button). Instead of using the Yale app, I primarily control this app with the ADT+ app, but there are versions of this lock that don\u0026#39;t use or require ADT\u0026#39;s service. I do wish I could set it to lock after every 10 minutes, rather than three, but that\u0026#39;s the longest option the ADT+ app gives me to set it. I can also partially control it in the Google Home app, but only to lock and unlock it, not to dive into detailed settings like passcodes and auto-lock times.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003e\u003ca href='https://cna.st/affiliate-link/4iheeJwWD8ieHpBRvZYS6hGdT7QChu5YEpZ9mFHZm1JaounZUBDVBJy8fUAAJMvXQ39mxSedJwoxaPcExEBLVMi2ZiZyVCpeVdHi6SexfMAMtgKhYrdEoquNrdhRqzJUu3rNaJNcW7QLZnLA6DPy7BpRmNuLRuypTSQ2fBf1hC7rRSq3T1ZgWWinDL' class='link'\u003eYale Assure Touchscreen Lever Lock for $230\u003c/a\u003e:\u003c/strong\u003e  I’ve been testing this no-deadbolt lever door handle with its sleek-looking keypad for a month on the door to my house from inside my garage.

It’s easy to lock and unlock and view the activity log on the Yale Access app, or you can use a pin code to unlock. You can also create different codes for different people to know exactly who’s been coming and going and when. It works with Google Home, Apple Home, and Alexa, and has also got two physical keys for backup in case of battery failure. Setup wasn’t exactly a breeze, requiring the Bilt app to install and then the Yale app to configure, and online reviews are quite voluminous in their complaints of both battery life and the handle becoming loose over time.

A 12-mile ride at over 20 mph depleted the battery to 50 percent in less than an hour, and I am a relatively small person (115 pounds). I would immediately put a double battery on this if you are considering it as a commuter.

The first time Waller-Bridge interrupts her own dialog to shoot a disarming, conspiratorial glance to the screen, you’re hooked. Season one is a smutty yet wonderful crescendo of self-destruction driven by a cast of characters that includes Fleabag’s intensely awkward sister Claire (Sian Clifford), her selfish and pretentious stepmother (Olivia Colman), and her clueless father (Bill Paterson). The second season cheerfully bounds into blasphemy as she grapples with inappropriate (and reciprocated) feelings for a Catholic priest (Andrew Scott). It’s shocking and immensely watchable—and one of the rare cases when a series truly is as good as people say.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003ca href='https://cna.st/affiliate-link/2uxxCQ7Rfr7UbUnAxYGAELuUNLVUw98ngbWkCRKBavvfcKS3cazhjh8gjskMMsFBA9Dy6gfDhbgCA8xNw21cAbJ4E4UPGt5aHpt2sNwYZCKnabNypx86ZSYYHWgNaZT2YVj8KJj8C' class='link'\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWatch on Amazon\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2 class='text-xl font-semibold'\u003e\u003cem class='italic'\u003eThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cfigure class='IframeEmbedWrapper-sc-dRedg kSrFfN iframe-embed'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003ciframe src='' width='200' height='113' class='border-0 mt-4' allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat is a New York lady to do when she finds out her husband is having an affair with his dim-witted secretary? If Mrs. Maisel is anything to go by, the answer is to head to a dingy watering hole in your nightgown, do a little standup comedy, and get hauled away by the police after flashing the entire audience. Set in the 1950s, this fast-talking fashionista hides her new life as a comedian from her family and ex while battling sexism, bad crowds, and big competition.

Kennedy Jr.\u0026#39;s office and included names, addresses, immigration status, and health claims, pertains to millions of enrollees, many in states that pay for the coverage using their own funds, the AP reports. The transfer may also be illegal, violating the Social Security Act and other data-handling statutes. According to the AP, Medicaid officials warned the administration that they did not have legal authority to disclose the records and that doing so would carry legal and reputation risks that could lead states to begin refusing to share information with the federal government, impacting the agency\u0026#39;s operational functions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eCalifornia governor Gavin Newsom, whose state is occupied by undesired federal military forces and ICE agents conducting continuous sweeps across neighborhoods heavily populated by immigrants, condemned the act, calling it “potentially illegal.” An HHS official rejected the claim, saying the agency acted in full compliance with the law, while declining to clarify to reporters how the data would actually be used.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 class='text-xl font-semibold'\u003e\u003ca href='https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/12/researchers-confirm-two-journalists-were-hacked-with-paragon-spyware/' class='link'\u003e2 Italian Journalists’ Phones Hacked With Paragon Spyware\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eMove over, NSO Group. Two Italian journalists were hacked with spyware made by Israeli phone-focused surveillance firm Paragon, Citizen Lab revealed this week in a report based on forensic analyses of their phones. Two other Italians, both staffers at the immigrant rescue nonprofit Mediterranea Saving Humans, also had their phones compromised with the same malware. Paragon’s Graphite malware, like NSO’s Pegasus, infects phones with a zero-click technique that requires no interaction from the victim—in this case using a vulnerability in iPhones that was patched in iOS version 18.3 earlier this year. While Citizen Lab couldn’t determine the Paragon customer behind the intrusions, there’s reason to suspect the Italian government, given that an Italian parliamentary committee determined in a report earlier this month that two Italian intelligence agencies are Paragon customers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 class='text-xl font-semibold'\u003e\u003ca href='https://therecord.media/ukraine-military-russia-strategic-bomber' class='link'\u003eUkraine Says It Hacked a Russian Aircraft Maker That Produces Strategic Bombers\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn its latest salvo against the Russian air force, Ukraine’s HUR military intelligence agency said that it had hacked into the network of Tupolev, an aerospace company that manufactures and services Russia’s strategic bombers. According to the cybersecurity news outlet The Record, the Ukrainian state hackers claim to have stolen 4.4 gigabytes of data, including internal communications, meeting notes, personnel files, and purchase records. Specifically, HUR says it was targeting data about individuals involved in the servicing and maintenance of Russia’s bomber fleet, which has targeted Ukrainian cities. The hackers also defaced the homepage of Tupolev’s website to show an owl clutching a Russian aircraft. “There is nothing secret left in Tupolev\u0026#39;s activities for Ukrainian intelligence,” HUR said in a statement. “The result of the operation will be noticeable both on the ground and in the sky.” The move follows Ukraine’s unprecedented drone operation earlier this month that damaged or destroyed 41 Russian aircraft, including bombers and spy planes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 class='text-xl font-semibold'\u003e\u003ca href='https://www.interpol.int/News-and-Events/News/2025/20-000-malicious-IPs-and-domains-taken-down-in-INTERPOL-infostealer-crackdown' class='link'\u003eInternational Law Enforcement Conducts Major Takedown of Infostealer Infrastructure\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn Wednesday, a consortium of cops from Interpol and 26 countries announced a takedown, dubbed “Operation Secure,” of domains and other digital infrastructure linked to 69 infostealer malware variants.

Operation Secure ran from January to April this year, Interpol said, and involved takedowns of more than 20,000 malicious IP addresses or domains and seizure of 41 servers as well as more than 100 GB of data. A total of 32 people were also arrested in connection with the investigation in Vietnam, Sri Lanka, Nauru, and elsewhere.

I only bought one planner, this would be the one. The Plum Paper A5 Planner has the perfect amount of customizability without feeling like I have to do too much work to create it, and has a lot of beautiful covers and color options to choose from. I personally love the Vertical Priorities layout, which I customized to include a priority section for my son, but you can choose from other layouts—there are 10 different types of layouts, going from vertical and horizontal to student and goal setting, then anywhere from two to four types of layouts within each type. You also choose from a huge variety of covers that you can customize with things like your name or the year, and choose from a huge range of add-ons like monthly workout summaries, baby tracking pages, and so much more.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe  \u003ca href='https://www.apprintable.com/a5-size.html' class='link'\u003eA5 size\u003c/a\u003e  is easy to use and tote around wherever I want, and you can have the planner start on any month you wish—great for if you want an annual planner suddenly in March or July without needing to skip all those extra months. You\u0026#39;ll find a two-sided folder in the back, which I usually use for stickers and urgent paperwork I need to handle. Speaking of stickers, I love Plum Paper\u0026#39;s chic sticker sets ($5+) that range from matching their add-on pages to cute seasonal stickers, and that I can make my own custom stickers on Plum Paper\u0026#39;s website.\u003c/p\u003e\u003chr class='my-4 border-t border-gray-300'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eAnother Great Weekly Planner\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003ca href='https://cna.st/p/7PpuYtEvLfvatp9mv5GRz6VPBzG477coTCxU9ZdQf8NKCxUwUDMbWBAkWzVzWUgpCMpT6jvWeCAVqQmQ8ADBY7mgpq7F5EdqBCaHQfP9K4T3cJGVEhuTEBLL4nVadnsyALkFswX5N9GTLCe8JQspZrZhwBGMyTfmreps9L5fR83wMN6rm2tqNxTc1LPi1aJMGDxea1QoxNA4eUTN9NEmRWfXyQttugMtCajd662xxQRY4ANsMhuC7e9nEzWqovTnoes6LEpsJqtDNHrKcKAe' class='link'\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cpicture class='ResponsiveImagePicture-cWuUZO dUOtEa responsive-image'\u003e\u003cimg src='https://media.wired.com/photos/64e3c41bc3f2cf2daf39fd52/4:3/w_748%2Cc_limit/Erin-Condren-LifePlanner-Gear.jpg' alt='Erin Condren LifePlanner'\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003ePhotograph: Amazon\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eErin Condren\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003ch3 class='text-xl font-medium'\u003eCoiled Weekly LifePlanner\u003c/h3\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003ca href='https://cna.st/p/7PpuYtEvLfvatp9mv5GRz6VPBzG477coTCxU9ZdQf8NKCxUwUDMbWBAkWzVzWUgpCMpT6jvWeCAVqQmQ8ADBY7mgpq7F5EdqBCaHQfP9K4T3cJGVEhuTEBLL4nVadnsyALkFswX5N9GTLCe8JQspZrZhwBGMyTfmreps9L5fR83wMN6rm2tqNxTc1LPi1aJMGDxea1QoxNA4eUTN9NEmRWfXyQttugMtCajd662xxQRY4ANsMhuC7e9nEzWqovTnoes6LEpsJqtDNHrKcKAe' class='link'\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan\u003e$45\u003c/span\u003e \u003cp\u003eAmazon\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003ca href='https://cna.st/p/FX1LF4r6izvTB7YiWdVoZ7S2QMwao23jxfFAdUSPtgqweFBaeVLB29NYLDpNVmEvrDes4K9bgmNXHMYsRAep9J1VUKZFjxaxVpJPTPUp6Np4qKbQiueu7PMRGreJe5BNNSDtdTw5vum1GHHgH2rTP99HGXc4hH6CeqRi99xYSSqo2Vxez6YAN9tNu2owMoHqmyofYbmfQ2Mx9pS3Pi7Lo6GeAZvAc8dGK2DL' class='link'\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan\u003e$61\u003c/span\u003e \u003cp\u003eErin Condren\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf Plum Planner\u0026#39;s designs aren\u0026#39;t quite for you, then explore the Erin Condren LifePlanner (ECLP for short).

That sounds intimidating, but Agendio makes it pretty easy with its fully custom planners, allowing you to choose from premade pages or designing your own (with some limitations—it\u0026#39;s not as open-ended as a program like Canva) to create the perfect monthly, weekly, and daily spreads. You can also design your own additional pages, like workout trackers or reading lists, that you can either add for each month or to the end of the planner.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026#39;s both a Pro designer, which I used to create fully custom pages and a specific layout, and a Classic designer, which is much simpler and lets you choose from premade pages. I really liked the cover options, and the default cover size (as long as you don\u0026#39;t add too many pages) will wrap around the planner\u0026#39;s coil to make it look like a sleek folder and protect the binding. It\u0026#39;s a great option if you tend to destroy things in your bag. It can easily become pricey with everything you can add, but it\u0026#39;s a really satisfying feeling to create your perfect planner and have it arrive at your front door, printed and bound.\u003c/p\u003e\u003chr class='my-4 border-t border-gray-300'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eBest Affordable Planner\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003csection class='CarouselWrapper-hZPzMO iVfMJM'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cul class='list-disc pl-5 space-y-2'\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003ca href='https://cna.st/p/F4467UzwXghrU5t8dt8AeULYdTji9Uy7x9xvXKo4hBxpWFPG6jByVscs4A3WgcASP3PYLxhc44PdUtx5pbZmb1qpwv5qRrb2mH6symiNwzdFoV9wou5JhBbsiriT2SGBkSkkdWJB1h28dBtYcgymSsfm1F6igPBYRtEhaPT15eVbGtxmWZz5c8g12Exz5no8u5As21dGJr4wuZDtWmYtzcKxV4XufBGTAMijvUTWHZojNYycUw4iT3v2CrqhZuzxgSYkvbYF95vqPSc4W4rg6d2hbt6r' class='link'\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cpicture class='ResponsiveImagePicture-cWuUZO dUOtEa responsive-image'\u003e\u003cimg src='https://media.wired.com/photos/684cb11634ca3a16f0545525/4:3/w_748%2Cc_limit/cherries%2520source%2520BanDo.png' alt='Image may contain: Page, Text, and Diary'\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eCourtesy of BanDo\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003ca href='https://cna.st/p/F4467UzwXghrU5t8dt8AeULYdTji9Uy7x9xvXKo4hBxpWFPG6jByVscs4A3WgcASP3PYLxhc44PdUtx5pbZmb1qpwv5qRrb2mH6symiNwzdFoV9wou5JhBbsiriT2SGBkSkkdWJB1h28dBtYcgymSsfm1F6igPBYRtEhaPT15eVbGtxmWZz5c8g12Exz5no8u5As21dGJr4wuZDtWmYtzcKxV4XufBGTAMijvUTWHZojNYycUw4iT3v2CrqhZuzxgSYkvbYF95vqPSc4W4rg6d2hbt6r' class='link'\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cpicture class='ResponsiveImagePicture-cWuUZO dUOtEa responsive-image'\u003e\u003cimg src='https://media.wired.com/photos/684cb0f2df5d9c8059755733/4:3/w_748%2Cc_limit/Ban.Do-Planner-Reviewer-Photo-SOURCE-Nena-Farrell.png' alt='A ring-bound paper planner open and laying flat on a white surface, the pages showing notes for end of July and start of August '\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003ePhotograph: Nena Farrell\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbutton class='BaseButton-bLlsy ButtonWrapper-xCepQ fhIjxp fCyinQ button button--utility CarouselControlButton-jSdLBg kKKdIh carousel-control-button--back'\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003csvg class='ButtonIcon-YqaGo iwlhuX button-icon icon icon-chevron'\u003e\u003ctitle\u003eChevron\u003c/title\u003e\u003c/svg\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/button\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbutton class='BaseButton-bLlsy ButtonWrapper-xCepQ fhIjxp fCyinQ button button--utility CarouselControlButton-jSdLBg kVmpLe carousel-control-button--forward'\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003csvg class='ButtonIcon-YqaGo iwlhuX button-icon icon icon-chevron'\u003e\u003ctitle\u003eChevron\u003c/title\u003e\u003c/svg\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/button\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/section\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eBan.do\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003ch3 class='text-xl font-medium'\u003e2025 Planners\u003c/h3\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003ca href='https://cna.st/p/F4467UzwXghrU5t8dt8AeULYdTji9Uy7x9xvXKo4hBxpWFPG6jByVscs4A3WgcASP3PYLxhc44PdUtx5pbZmb1qpwv5qRrb2mH6symiNwzdFoV9wou5JhBbsiriT2SGBkSkkdWJB1h28dBtYcgymSsfm1F6igPBYRtEhaPT15eVbGtxmWZz5c8g12Exz5no8u5As21dGJr4wuZDtWmYtzcKxV4XufBGTAMijvUTWHZojNYycUw4iT3v2CrqhZuzxgSYkvbYF95vqPSc4W4rg6d2hbt6r' class='link'\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan\u003e$30\u003c/span\u003e \u003cp\u003eAmazon (2025 Planner)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003ca href='https://cna.st/p/5B83M5vYZfeZ6TP6pUtRyWQ4769KdmCZvsxT9ie1U8UvBuVGQXAVTgJ3mWXXXGNCrAYvxpdfikTsNDdgY7dijKCvxB3RnxCLVfetS8KW9QimYWV7tE7NY3TEDg4nrt5iUgMgQTQc3N8NFssWSVxcsKb3TkiySjnxLFo6Cwwtminv6o7kRE7xxz96rZ68My1yNcC86apGTHarCqmgCwpyRsek2HA6rBPC64TgLAHAcNLpG7cHL6AvDXt52xxuS9niwD6xNH6E8Kyh8Qi6wHX2uywepCXxvf54eCYzuex3tT9guMgQFYwiTbPUnBDbxZvy3BFv8cbg' class='link'\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan\u003e$30\u003c/span\u003e \u003cp\u003eBan.do (2025-2025 Planner)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere are a lot of quirky planners, but Ban.do is one of the most fun options that\u0026#39;s in just about everyone\u0026#39;s budget.

has become my new go-to planner, because I am notorious for multiple lists. Especially as a mom, there\u0026#39;s often one list for work, one list for home and parenting tasks, plus other random lists like which workout outfits I want to wear this week and a packing list for a trip I won\u0026#39;t take for a month. I need a lot of room to corral my ideas, and the Purpose Planner actually has room for it all. The weekly spread includes five to-do list areas, from work to home and projects and stuff to buy, plus smaller checklists for each day and plenty of space to write in my schedule. Not only that, but there are two full dotted pages after each weekly spread for me to doodle, brainstorm, and write more lists all over for that specific week. The monthly spread has six lists, plus six sections to reflect on when the month ends.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026#39;s a six-month, undated planner, so you can pick it up any time of the year and start using it. You do need to sit down and write in things like the months and dates, but I found that fun and satisfying to do. I also liked adding some color coding with highlighters to add a little fun to the pages. There are also some fun pages in the front to reflect and plan for your roles in life, goals you want to achieve, and books you want to read.

There\u0026#39;re five undated weeks for each month, so you\u0026#39;ll have to check your digital calendar to confirm which dates are where, but that also means there\u0026#39;s plenty of room for each month to write down what\u0026#39;s coming up and extra notes if you need. There are 25 spots on the to-do list, and I liked using it for my main seasonal goals (like apple picking in the fall, seeing the zoo holiday lights in the winter) and major to-do items (like getting my car emissions checked and purchasing train tickets). While it can\u0026#39;t replace a weekly or daily planner if you like daily to-do lists, I loved using these sheets to get a birds-eye view of the upcoming season. \u003cem class='italic'\u003e—Nena Farrell\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003chr class='my-4 border-t border-gray-300'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003ch2 class='text-xl font-semibold'\u003ePlanner Alternatives\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eNot everyone needs or wants a rigid planner.

No missed days to make you feel guilty. Midori’s notebooks are designed to fit inside notebook or journal covers (which you can find all over Etsy).

The big news in the X-E5 is Fujifilm\u0026#39;s latest 40-megapixel APS-C sensor and 7-stop in-body image stabilization (IBIS). This is the first X-E series camera with IBIS, which Fujifilm says will gain you about 7 stops of handholding. The new sensor also means video specs jump to 6.2K at 30 frames per second (with a 1.23 crop) and 4K 30 fps full sensor video.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe X-E5 regains the focus mode switch on the side of the body (notably absent from the X-E4), and adds a new film simulation dial. While many of Fujifilm\u0026#39;s enthusiast-level cameras have this control, the one on the X-E5 can store custom presets with your own film recipes. One thing that remains unchanged is the weather sealing, which still doesn\u0026#39;t exist here. Also disappointing is that the viewfinder remains small, with the same paltry resolution (2.36M dot, 1025 x 768) as the older model.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class='AssetEmbedWrapper-eVDQiB byBkf asset-embed'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cpicture class='ResponsiveImagePicture-cWuUZO dUOtEa AssetEmbedResponsiveAsset-cXBNxi lqMXz asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image'\u003e\u003cimg src='https://media.wired.com/photos/684cb9becd37c89352df3f24/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Fujifilm%2520X-E5%2520SOURCE%2520Fujifilm.png' alt='Image may contain Camera Digital Camera and Electronics'\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003eCourtesy of Fujifilm\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe X-E5 will be available in the US in August for $1,699 for the body only and $1,899 for a version with Fujifilm\u0026#39;s new 23mm f/2.8R WR lens, launching alongside the X-E5.

But that sucks up valuable battery life and can also introduce some delay as the request ping pongs to the phone and back. By integrating the capability to process a small language model directly via the AR1+ chip on smart glasses, you can expect faster response, better battery life, and improved privacy as everything stays on device. That also means you don\u0026#39;t need your phone nearby to get a response from an AI chatbot.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe AR1+ chipset is also 26 percent smaller than its predecessor, which Qualcomm thinks will help make smart glasses slightly less cumbersome to wear.

Blacklock told Grist the organization based its wildfire project on  \u003ca href='https://www.fs.usda.gov/rm/pubs_journals/2024/rmrs_2024_davis_k001.pdf' class='link'\u003eresearch\u003c/a\u003e  known as the Tamm Review, which found that thinning combined with prescribed burns can reduce wildfire severity by 62 to 72 percent.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut climate scientist Dominick DellaSala said the authors of the Tamm Review mis-cited their own work and ignored 37 papers contradicting their findings. “The forest is no longer a forest,” DellaSala added. “The fire-thinning question has been very narrowly scoped to get a preconceived outcome … None of them look at the collateral damages to ecosystems and the climate—only if fuels are reduced enough to lower intensity.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eKim Davis, research ecologist with the USDA Forest Service and lead author of the 2014 Tamm Review study, said she stands by the findings that mechanical treatments can reduce future fire severity when combined with prescribed fires, adding that the 37 studies DellaSala cited were not included because they did not meet sufficiently strict scientific standards. “This research underwent rigorous statistical, technical, and peer review,” said Davis. “We respectfully disagree with the statement that our work improperly cited or misrepresented studies and data.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn any case, the US Forest Service already cuts down dense areas of forest it believes are particularly at risk from wildfires and burns them in controlled areas, known as slash piles. Blacklock said that the partnership between Drax and GSNR shares this same objective. From GSNR’s perspective, and that of many local politicians, using wood which would otherwise be needlessly burned in wood-pellet facilities is a win-win.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut campaigners say that, in other markets, Drax and its subsidiaries have extended their operations beyond slash piles, cutting down healthy trees to make wood pellets. In  \u003ca href='https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-63089348' class='link'\u003e2022\u003c/a\u003e , the BBC uncovered that wood used in Drax facilities had come from clear-cut primary forests in Canada, which can take thousands of years to grow back. A year later, after residents of a town in British Columbia, Canada, asked Drax to help clear nearby slash piles, Environment Ministry employees told  \u003ca href='https://thetyee.ca/Analysis/2023/04/28/Pellet-Plant-Clean-Air-Fail/' class='link'\u003eThe Tyee\u003c/a\u003e  that tens of thousands of trees from healthy forests were being turned into wood pellets.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLarge trees of the kind chopped down in Canada act as wind buffers, according to DellaSala. When these trees are removed in logging operations, like opening the air vent on a wood stove, the increased ventilation can cause a fire to spread quickly. “If a fire occurs it can spread rapidly through the forest due to higher wind speeds and drying out of the understory by tree canopy removals,” said DellaSala. “Hence the forest is over-ventilated and more prone to fast-moving, wind-spread fires.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe pellet mills, which have a history of setting on fire and producing piles of combustible dust, have to be built in clearings within forests so that woody fuel can be delivered. Although GSNR assured residents it follows strict fire protocols, the proximity to the forest made some residents nervous, and has compounded worries that the wildfire treatment plan will make fires more likely, not less.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDrax’s involvement has also not reassured them.

They were like, “There are hordes of people. They have taken over Los Angeles. This is wild.” The truth of the matter was that these were in very specific areas and very much linked to ICE raids. But over the weekend things took a turn. Trump called in the National Guard, much to California governor Gavin Newsom\u0026#39;s chagrin, and there was a lot of back-and-forth online about states\u0026#39; rights versus federal rights versus how all of this was getting depicted. Lots of arrests, a lot of people really upset about this administration\u0026#39;s pretty controversial immigration policies, and some pretty dismaying imagery of ICE raids, not just in LA but throughout the country. So this has been boiling up for quite some time, and LA is really one of the first places that we\u0026#39;re seeing this kind of response.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eZoë Schiffer:\u003c/strong\u003e  Yeah, I mean, I think that\u0026#39;s what really stood out to me from the beginning. It feels like kind of the first time that we\u0026#39;ve seen a groundswell of opposition to the Trump administration in a really full-throated way, in a way that I think we expected to see at various points throughout this administration since January. But we really haven\u0026#39;t so far, despite the fact that what they\u0026#39;ve been doing, what they\u0026#39;ve been saying is pretty unusual compared to how politics normally run.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eLeah Feiger:\u003c/strong\u003e  Absolutely. It\u0026#39;s been kind of wild, and obviously there\u0026#39;s been the Tesla Takedown protest movement and a couple of smaller protests that happened right when DOGE, Elon Musk\u0026#39;s so-called Department of Government Efficiency, was kicking off. But you\u0026#39;re totally right, there has not been anything in this specific way, and part of this is because it\u0026#39;s just really incredibly personal. We\u0026#39;re hearing stories from protesters about their family members being taken by ICE and not hearing from them again. There\u0026#39;s been some amazing profiles across the country of people being shocked that their neighbors were taken off the streets. And again, the administration has been saying that they\u0026#39;re going to be doing this the entire time. The big difference here is, one, the response from people in the community in LA, and two, the fact that this is now really becoming a state\u0026#39;s rights versus federal issue.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eZoë Schiffer:\u003c/strong\u003e  And I feel like as this has been unfolding, even for you and me, we\u0026#39;ve been trying to figure out, like you said, what is really going on here? What is happening? And so one of the things that they\u0026#39;ve been doing, very 2025, is turning to chatbots, asking ChatGPT, asking Grok, what\u0026#39;s happening here?\u0026#34; So what are some of those questions that people are trying to get answered, and what is happening when they talk to chatbots about what\u0026#39;s going on?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eLeah Feiger:\u003c/strong\u003e  OK. A little bit of a controversial take to get us started. I think there\u0026#39;s actually something incredibly pure about people seeing a photo or a video on social media and going, “Wait, is this real? Is this accurate?” That\u0026#39;s actually kind of good. That to me is a good thing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eZoë Schiffer:\u003c/strong\u003e  Yeah, media literacy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eLeah Feiger:\u003c/strong\u003e  Media literacy. We\u0026#39;ve been screaming about this for so long. But the devastating part of this is that these chatbots are just absolutely not up to the challenge. So can I give you an example here? Would that be OK?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eZoë Schiffer:\u003c/strong\u003e  Please, please.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eLeah Feiger:\u003c/strong\u003e  OK. So obviously there\u0026#39;s been these people taking to the streets following these ICE raids, and conservative posters have been totally flooding their feeds with inaccurate information. They\u0026#39;ve been posting old protest footage, clips from video games, movies, claiming that there\u0026#39;s all of these agitators. It\u0026#39;s been a lot. And as a result, people have been turning to AI chatbots like Grok, et cetera. So one of these specific cases is when the federal government sent in 2,000 National Guard troops, the SF Chronicle actually published a photo of these troops sleeping on the floor. These images were shared by Governor Newsom, who was like, “You literally sent these troops to our state that we did not ask for, that is fully inciting this situation, and now they actually have nowhere to sleep.” Right after Newsom shared this, a ton of people were claiming on X, on Facebook that these images were fabrications, they were AI generated, or they were totally referencing a different event. And we\u0026#39;re not just talking random posters. We\u0026#39;re talking like Laura Loomer, queen of the conspiracists.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eZoë Schiffer:\u003c/strong\u003e  Oh, wow.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eLeah Feiger:\u003c/strong\u003e  Yeah, exactly. Who has Trump\u0026#39;s ear already. This became widespread. And so people went to X\u0026#39;s Grok and they were like, “Grok, what is this?” And what did Grok tell them? No, no. Grok said these were not actually images from the protest in LA. It said they were from Afghanistan.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eZoë Schiffer:\u003c/strong\u003e  Oh. Grok, no.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eLeah Feiger:\u003c/strong\u003e  They were like, “There\u0026#39;s no credible support. This is misattribution.” It was really bad. It was really, really bad. And then there was another situation where another couple of people were sharing these photos with ChatGPT, and ChatGPT was also like, “Yep, this is Afghanistan. This isn\u0026#39;t accurate, et cetera, et cetera.” It\u0026#39;s not great.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eZoë Schiffer:\u003c/strong\u003e  I mean, don\u0026#39;t get me started on this moment coming after a lot of these platforms have systematically dismantled their fact-checking programs, have decided to purposefully let through a lot more content. And then you add chatbots into the mix who, for all of their uses, and I do think they can be really useful, they are incredibly confident. When they do hallucinate, when they do mess up, they do it in a way that is very convincing. You will not see me out here defending Google Search. Absolute trash, nightmare, but it\u0026#39;s a little more clear when that\u0026#39;s going astray, when you\u0026#39;re on some random, uncredible blog than when Grok tells you with complete confidence that you\u0026#39;re seeing a photo of Afghanistan when you\u0026#39;re not.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eLeah Feiger:\u003c/strong\u003e  It\u0026#39;s really concerning. I mean, it\u0026#39;s hallucinating. It\u0026#39;s fully hallucinating, but with the swagger of the drunkest frat boy that you\u0026#39;ve ever unfortunately been cornered by at a party in your life.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eZoë Schiffer:\u003c/strong\u003e  Nightmare. Nightmare. Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eLeah Feiger:\u003c/strong\u003e  They\u0026#39;re like “No, no, no. I am sure. I have never been more sure in my life.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eZoë Schiffer:\u003c/strong\u003e  Absolutely. I mean, OK, so why do chatbots give these incorrect answers with such confidence? Why aren\u0026#39;t we seeing them just say, “Well, I don\u0026#39;t know, so maybe you should check elsewhere. Here are a few credible places to go look for that answer and that information.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eLeah Feiger:\u003c/strong\u003e  Because they don\u0026#39;t do that. They don\u0026#39;t admit that they don\u0026#39;t know, which is really wild to me. There\u0026#39;s actually been a lot of studies about this, and in a recent study of AI search tools at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University, it found that chatbots were “generally bad at declining to answer questions they couldn\u0026#39;t answer accurately. Offering instead incorrect or speculative answers.” Really, really, really wild, especially when you consider the fact that there were so many articles during the election about, “Oh no, sorry, I\u0026#39;m ChatGPT and I can\u0026#39;t weigh in on politics.” You\u0026#39;re like, well, you\u0026#39;re weighing in on a lot now.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eZoë Schiffer:\u003c/strong\u003e  OK, I think we should pause there on that very horrifying note and we\u0026#39;ll be right back.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[break]\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eZoë Schiffer:\u003c/strong\u003e  Welcome back to  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eUncanny Valley\u003c/em\u003e . I\u0026#39;m joined today by Leah Feiger, senior politics editor at WIRED. OK, so beyond just trying to verify information and footage, there\u0026#39;ve also been a bunch of reports about misleading AI-generated videos. There was a TikTok account that started uploading videos of an alleged National Guard soldier named Bob who\u0026#39;d been deployed to the LA protests, and you could see him saying false and inflammatory things like like the fact that the protesters are “chucking in balloons full of oil,” and one of the videos had close to a million views. So I don\u0026#39;t know, it feels like people have to become a little more adept at identifying this kind of fake footage, but it\u0026#39;s hard in an environment that is inherently contextless like a post on X or a video on TikTok.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eLeah Feiger:\u003c/strong\u003e  Totally. And that TikTok live stream that you mentioned from Bob, that got debunked by BBC, they took it down. That\u0026#39;s gone. But people in response are like, “Oh my gosh, this is the mainstream media. They\u0026#39;re just shutting this down. Here\u0026#39;s this information.” So it\u0026#39;s like when you find the thing, when you debunk the thing, it is still not enough. And I have to get back to the questions of media literacy, and that\u0026#39;s perhaps why the AI chatbots getting it wrong are so upsetting to me, because people are actually, not everyone, but there is for sure some good-faith folks going, “Is this real? Please, someone tell me if this is real.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eZoë Schiffer:\u003c/strong\u003e  Oh, absolutely. Yeah, they want to know. I know. My poor mom, she showed me a video the other day of a bunch of identical baby sloths looking at the camera. She was like, “Aren\u0026#39;t these so cute? I found this on Facebook.” And I was like, “Mom, those are not real sloths. We need to move on.” She was crushed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eLeah Feiger:\u003c/strong\u003e  I think though that AI animal slop is something I may be OK with.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eZoë Schiffer:\u003c/strong\u003e  The one form of AI that Leah likes is the AI animals.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eLeah Feiger:\u003c/strong\u003e  Nope, nope, I take it back. Anyway, lower stakes, but arguably still contributing to the fact that what\u0026#39;s real? I don\u0026#39;t know. Who\u0026#39;s to say? And the part of the thing is we\u0026#39;ve in some ways been here before. Five years ago was 2020 and the George Floyd protests across the country, and those were massive, and those were big, and we had a lot of issues of misinformation. We had a lot of people that were saying, “No, this is this. This is this video game. This is this.” But five years later, the landscape has entirely changed. You still have the same bad actors, but it\u0026#39;s now way more confusing. Trust in the media is down. Who do you turn to? Your trusty AI chatbot that has been integrated into every single social media app that you have personal access to.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eZoë Schiffer:\u003c/strong\u003e  Which has also stripped away the other fact-checking mechanisms. So here we are.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eLeah Feiger:\u003c/strong\u003e  Yes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eZoë Schiffer:\u003c/strong\u003e  We\u0026#39;ve seen this again and again. I mean, it\u0026#39;s been interesting because Elon Musk famously laid off a large portion of the content moderation team at X, formerly Twitter. He also stripped away some of the content moderation rules that the company had spent years weighing and putting in place and debating internally. And as we\u0026#39;ve had big news events play out in real time, the kind of thing that Twitter was made to do, big earthquake, war, protests, whatever it is, these moments where previously you would\u0026#39;ve seen everyone flock to X to figure out what was going on, you still see people doing that same behavior, but the ability to ascertain what is actually going on on that platform has declined so much in recent years. There is good information, but it\u0026#39;s intermixed with all of this horrible, bad, false information, and it\u0026#39;s really hard to tell what is what.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eLeah Feiger:\u003c/strong\u003e  It is such a mess, and I am not an X poster anymore, but I do go on frequently to see what\u0026#39;s up. It\u0026#39;s trash. It\u0026#39;s a combination right now in this very specific moment because Elon Musk is back and posting nonstop about space travel, so it\u0026#39;s like we have the Elon Musk posts that are at the very top of my feed. We have the LA is burning, the fire is spreading to the rest of America, and then we have a couple of journalists still hanging out being like, “Read my story.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eZoë Schiffer:\u003c/strong\u003e  Getting no traction? Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eLeah Feiger:\u003c/strong\u003e  And it\u0026#39;s so sad. Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eZoë Schiffer:\u003c/strong\u003e  Yeah, I mean, if you are someone who\u0026#39;s trying to become an X influencer, the kind of things that you need to share are inherently a little divisive, a little inflammatory, a little shocking. In some cases, they\u0026#39;re getting paid by the platform to post this kind of content. I think that there are a few guardrails in place. If you have a community note on a post, you\u0026#39;re not supposed to get money for it, but the incentive structure, like you mentioned, is set up to encourage people to post the craziest thing they can possibly get away with, and that\u0026#39;s what we\u0026#39;re seeing right now.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eLeah Feiger:\u003c/strong\u003e  Although I have to say for what? It\u0026#39;s to line the pockets of these companies and these billionaire owners, but the actual posters, I\u0026#39;m sure that many people have made the grift, but there was this amazing New York Times article pretty recently about a very, very established—\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eZoë Schiffer:\u003c/strong\u003e  Right.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eLeah Feiger:\u003c/strong\u003e  Yeah, the poster on X. And he was like, “I\u0026#39;m a Republican, and this is what I care about.” He spends no vacations, no weekends. His entire day is on his computer and he\u0026#39;s making something like, it\u0026#39;s less than $60,000 a year, to which I\u0026#39;m just like, what is the incentive? Is the incentive that amazing hit of serotonin when you have a tweet go viral? That can\u0026#39;t pay groceries? So the fact that Musk and Zuckerberg and all of these folks have managed to convince people that this is still the place to be with more incendiary, inaccurate content is arguably the greatest grift of all.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eZoë Schiffer:\u003c/strong\u003e  Yeah.

I want to know, was I supposed to get that extra $5? I would like to know. And this writer did it. They did it. They are on the path. They talk to people who are involved in getting people their money, and this statistic will haunt me forever, which is that something like only 4 percent of these class action lawsuit claims, what comes out, are actually ever claimed by people that deserve it.

Federal troops are prohibited from arresting civilians, searching property, and collecting evidence. They may not conduct surveillance of US persons. That includes not just individuals but vehicles, locations, and “transactions.” They may not serve as undercover agents, informants, or interrogators. Unless a crime is committed by a service member or on military property, Title 10 forces are likewise banned from engaging in any kind of forensics for the benefit of civilian police—unless they are willing to put in writing that such evidence was obtained by consent.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eUS Northern Command, which oversees military support to nonmilitary authorities in the contiguous 48 states,  \u003ca href='https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-marines-carry-out-first-known-detention-civilian-los-angeles-video-shows-2025-06-13/' class='link'\u003esaid Friday\u003c/a\u003e  that Marines would not conduct “arrests” but are authorized to \u0026#34;temporarily hold\u0026#34; people in \u0026#34;specific circumstances\u0026#34; until police arrive to make a  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eformal\u003c/em\u003e  arrest. The clarification follows the emergence of a video showing Marines in LA detaining a civilian with plastic handcuffs before awaiting police—the first known instance of such an action during the current deployment.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere are numerous other scenarios in which the military can provide assistance to police, including by giving them “information” obtained “in the normal course” of their duties, unless applicable privacy laws prohibit it. Military members can also provide police with a wide variety of assistance so long as it’s in a “private capacity” and they’re off duty. Additionally, they can provide “expert advice,” so long as it doesn’t count as serving a function core to civilian police work.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Department of Defense did not immediately respond to a request for comment; however, a staff member in the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy confirmed for WIRED by phone the current set of policies under which deployed federal troops must operate.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere is one major caveat to the military’s restrictions. During an “extraordinary emergency,” military commanders may take limited, immediate action to prevent massive destruction or to restore critical public services, but only so long as presidential approval is “impossible” to obtain in advance. And while military personnel are naturally expected to maintain order and discipline at all times, under no circumstances are they required to stand down when their lives, or the lives of others, are in immediate danger.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStill, enforcement of these rules in the field is far from guaranteed.

Trump administration officials have also demonstrated a willingness to skirt the law. Last week, homeland security secretary Kristi Noem asked the Pentagon to authorize military assistance in conducting arrests and to deploy drone surveillance, according to a letter  \u003ca href='https://www.sfchronicle.com/us-world/article/noem-immigration-protests-letter-20369001.php' class='link'\u003eobtained by The San Francisco Chronicle\u003c/a\u003e —a move experts say directly contradicts standing legal prohibitions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt a press conference on Thursday, Noem stated the federal government was on a mission to “liberate” Los Angeles from “socialists” and the “leadership” of California governor Gavin Newsom and LA mayor Karen Bass. US Senator Alex Padilla, who represents the citizens of California, was  \u003ca href='https://www.politico.com/news/2025/06/12/california-sen-alex-padilla-handcuffed-at-noem-presser-00403253' class='link'\u003eforcibly removed\u003c/a\u003e  from the press conference after attempting to question Noem.

Those who do typically belong to military police or specialized security units.

this is\u003c/span\u003e  not an elaborate April fool”. This is how WIRED first reported on the Dyson Zone at the end of March 2022. The Zone was a wild reimagining of an established product type—a big, bulky pair of headphones with an integrated air-purification mechanism that presented rather unfortunately like a high-tech gimp mask. A solution to a problem no consumer seemed willing to acknowledge existed in the first place.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWorse was to follow. December 2022: “Dyson’s hellish-looking air-purifying headset will cost $950.” And in May 2023,  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/review/review-dyson-zone/' class='link'\u003eour review\u003c/a\u003e  made liberal use of words like “embarrassing”, “troubling” and “derision,” and suggested the reviewer felt like “a Fisher Price Batman villain” while wearing them. “You can finally buy this bizarre, head-mounted contraption—but for pity’s sake, don’t”.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eZone marked the first time Dyson’s chief engineer (and son of James) Jake Dyson had been project lead for a product since he folded Jake Dyson Products into the Dyson portfolio. At the time, he was bullish about the Zone’s chances: “After six years in development, we’re excited to deliver pure air and pure audio, anywhere.” Since then, Dyson has gone eerily quiet on promoting the Zone, and now your chances of acquiring a pair are close to nil.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the United States, everyone from SportPursuit to Best Buy is out of stock, and retailers show no sign of doing anything about the situation. At the time of writing, Walmart\u0026#39;s website reckons there is one pair left throughout the entirety of the retail giant. In the UK, meanwhile, retailer John Lewis is unequivocal: “We will not receive more stock of this item”.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn fact, it seems the only place where you can still buy the Dyson Zone is at Dyson.com—and even here, the product is far from front and center. Should you find yourself able to navigate to the relevant page, you’ll have to scroll down a  \u003cem class='italic'\u003elong way\u003c/em\u003e  to get to an image of the headphones with their air-purification muzzle attached.

So it seemed only right to discuss the Zone\u0026#39;s fallout, look at Dyson\u0026#39;s altogether more successful (and de facto replacement model) OnTrac headphones, and, considering that Jake’s first swing for the company has turned out to be such a high-profile miss, find out Dyson’s future plans in the audio world.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cfigure class='AssetEmbedWrapper-eVDQiB byBkf asset-embed'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cpicture class='ResponsiveImagePicture-cWuUZO dUOtEa AssetEmbedResponsiveAsset-cXBNxi lqMXz asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image'\u003e\u003cimg src='https://media.wired.com/photos/6849f3c9390ded5979e0a0e2/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Jake%2520Dyson%2520wearing%2520Zone.jpg' alt='Image may contain David Hewlett Adult Person Transportation Truck Vehicle Electronics Headphones Bus and Light'\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cp\u003eJake Dyson at the 2023 London launch of the now discontinued Zone, a project he spearheaded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003eCourtesy of Dyson\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e“[With the Zone] we thought we could bring something better to the table than what’s currently out there,\u0026#34; says Jake Dyson. \u0026#34;You get pure delivery of undisturbed air, and join that with headphones because you have to wear it on your head. So combine the two, you make it a more attractive proposition … there’s added value. It brings a bit of fun and spirit to the product. And, of course, the visor is detachable—it can be something you wear in your hour of need, and then take it off and you’ve got an audio headset.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut it is this leap with the air-purifying Zone that many could not quite fathom: “You’ve got to wear it, so let’s make it headphones.” What made Dyson go there in particular? And, moreover, when it became clear this would be such a hard ask, many brands would rethink things—yet Dyson plowed on anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“I’ll be completely honest, quite often we work in an obsessive nature,\u0026#34; says Jake. \u0026#34;We want this product. We want to make this thing. Sometimes before actually evaluating what the market response might be. And the market didn’t exist. So you’ve got to take those risks.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThose risks are thrown into stark relief when you consider the market response to Zone. A product that is only two years old, yet you seemingly can’t buy it anywhere now apart from on Dyson’s site. Has Dyson quietly killed the Zone?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“First thing: Zone was completely ahead of its time,\u0026#34; says Jake. \u0026#34;It’s solving a problem that is quite niche—the amount of people that are neurotic about air pollution, that want to solve that problem, and are willing to spend an amount of money; coupled with the fact that it’s headphones, means your market is small. We have sold thousands. And we still have the tooling—but we’ve stopped manufacturing it. We haven’t thrown the tools away. It’s something we believe will come around in the future. It’s a brilliant product.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s worth noting at this point that, outside of Dyson, the Zone isn’t universally regarded as being a brilliant product. According to one major retailer in the US, “most people read it as a gimmick or another Google Glass–type product. For price, aesthetic, and performance, the space already has highly compelling offers from brands established as experts. Why would Dyson want to do ‘that’ when what it is good at is ‘this’”?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlan Sircom, editor of globally respected  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eHi-Fi+\u003c/em\u003e  magazine, goes even further. “The Zone is too odd, in my opinion. Anything that reminds people of wearing masks during  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/tag/coronavirus/' class='link'\u003eCovid\u003c/a\u003e  is dead in the water. I’d forgotten about it—that’s how little market penetration Dyson has [with the Zone].”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDyson, of course, is a privately owned company and consequently not obliged to release any information regarding the success (or otherwise) of the Zone. But Ivan Lam, senior analyst at Counterpoint, doubts anyone can be happy with its performance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class='AssetEmbedWrapper-eVDQiB byBkf asset-embed'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cpicture class='ResponsiveImagePicture-cWuUZO dUOtEa AssetEmbedResponsiveAsset-cXBNxi lqMXz asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image'\u003e\u003cimg src='https://media.wired.com/photos/6849f42013b5167e6372c89c/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/zone%2520prototypes.jpg' alt='Image may contain Pede B Electronics Headphones Adult and Person'\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cp\u003eZone prototypes map the internal development of the air-purifying headphones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003eCourtesy of Dyson\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Zone was the result of six years of modeling and testing, of making maybe dozens of tooling models. Even if you just assume a team of 10 people, working on this project for six years, you’re talking about a lot of expense,” Lam says. “Sound tuning is expensive, prototype testing is very expensive. It’s hard to calculate exactly, but I’m sure it will have cost tens of millions of dollars. And the result is a product with no revenue, no profit margin, and no visibility. I haven’t seen a single pair being worn in Hong Kong.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd Hong Kong is not the only Asian territory where the anecdotal evidence for Zone is uninspiring, despite the fact that Dyson is a revered brand name in Asia, with huge presence. No major retailer can help you.

At  \u003ca href='https://www.e-earphone.jp/' class='link'\u003ee-Earphone\u003c/a\u003e , Japan’s largest headphone retailer, they’re not available either.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href='https://www.yodobashi.com/' class='link'\u003eYodobashi\u003c/a\u003e  is the world’s largest chain of electronics stores, but when WIRED visited the Kyoto branch recently the Dyson Zone was conspicuous only by its absence—and this is an electronics store with a “wireless headphones” department that has a footprint comfortably larger than that of the average Japanese apartment.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDyson launched its OnTrac regular over-ear noise-canceling headphones with no wider innovative/unnecessary/bizarre (reader\u0026#39;s choice) functionality in July 2024, just over a year after the Zone. And as a way of entering the market with a product that doesn’t actively scare people, and of competing with established brands on a like-for-like basis, it looks like a sensible move.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCertainly,  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/review/dyson-ontrac/' class='link'\u003eour review of the OnTrac\u003c/a\u003e  discusses the excellent noise-canceling, the nicely balanced sound, and the interesting industrial design. We gave them an 8 out of 10, along with a coveted “WIRED Recommends” badge—a far cry from the Zone’s rating, and quite the turnaround. Jake is justifiably proud of them. Also, the move from Zone to OnTrac shows a definite path despite the poor fortunes of Dyson\u0026#39;s first swing at audio.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“We’ve learned a lot of lessons. It would be stupid not to take things further in audio,\u0026#34; says Jake. \u0026#34;Looking at other headphones out there, they all just look the same: black plastic, not very nice forms. Aesthetically, there’s something deeply missing in terms of headphones. We thought we could achieve the best noise-canceling out there, and also bring something more interesting in terms of design. Engineer a beautiful product, bring customization, and more of a fashion element.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs OnTrac has clearly sold significantly more than Zone, does Dyson consider Zone to be a product that didn’t work, and OnTrac one that did? “[We\u0026#39;ve sold] ten-fold [more]—and we launched OnTrac last July, although you could say September was when it came to life. It normally takes about six months before people realize there’s something there. OnTrac worked. [As for the Zone] we never deem anything to be a failure, because we always learn something.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo affirm this point, Jake Dyson says that OnTrac is not merely the same headphones as Zone but with the fan system removed. “We’ve taken the advancement of the noise-canceling and enhanced it even further,” he says. “We’ve increased the software capability, so the range of sound, from the treble to the bass, is expanded.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class='AssetEmbedWrapper-eVDQiB byBkf asset-embed'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cpicture class='ResponsiveImagePicture-cWuUZO dUOtEa AssetEmbedResponsiveAsset-cXBNxi lqMXz asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image'\u003e\u003cimg src='https://media.wired.com/photos/684ac1087549b5adbe53f01e/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/DIGITAL%2520NFGU_WP02_DKBLABCO_034-RGB-FilmStill-FrontOn-Exploded-CustomCaps-Cushions-A3_GRAD%2520copy.jpg' alt='Image may contain Electronics and Headphones'\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cp\u003eCompared to the polarizing Zone, Dyson\u0026#39;s OnTrac headphones have supposedly been a relative success.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003eCourtesy of Dyson\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf WIRED knows anything about the market for premium wireless over-ear headphones, though, it’s that the space is crammed with products from profoundly well-regarded brands—brands that have won their credibility through decades of experience in many areas of the audio market. Dyson, which is starting from a base of just about zero (if you accept that the relative success of OnTrac balances out the catastrophe of Zone), will need to establish a reputation for audio excellence pretty fast if it’s going to compete.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe impressive and numerous  \u003ca href='https://www.dyson.co.uk/headphones/ontrac/accessories' class='link'\u003ecustomization options\u003c/a\u003e  for OnTrac are a start (and more are on the way), but in the area of the market in which Dyson seems determined to compete, thoughtful industrial design is a minimum. Reputations are won and lost in every department: sound quality, obviously, and the standard of active noise-cancellation, ergonomics, extended functionality, and headline technologies are all important, too. It is a sad fact that many brands with greater audio chops than Dyson have floundered.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat’s not to say Dyson can’t make it happen, though. The company will have taken a lot of learning away from its (ultimately fruitless)  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/dyson-electric-car-cancelled-inside-story/' class='link'\u003eN526 electric car project\u003c/a\u003e —and let’s not overlook the fact that Dyson is a brand that usually gets where it intends to go. The company’s hits hugely outweigh its misses—and there seems no reason to assume the combination of engineering expertise and sheer persistence that has made James Dyson a billionaire is about to desert the brand any time soon.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd perhaps most importantly of all, the whole Zone experience has led Jake Dyson to an extremely important realization—at least when it comes to headphones: “One of the things we’ve learned is obviously people really do bloody care about what it looks like when it’s on your head.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","publishedAt":"2025-06-13T11:30:00Z","categories":["Gear","Gear / Gear News and Events","End Zone"],"keywords":["Shopping, buying guides, birds, outdoor, smart home","Shopping, buying guides, TVs, home entertainment, 4K","review, mattresses, Shopping, online shopping, Reviews, household","Quanta Magazine, space, science, Jupiter, volcanoes, NASA, satellite images","video games, Playstation, Sony, COVID-19, Console Games","laptops, Shopping, how-to, Computers, Windows, PCs, operating systems","extremism, law enforcement, politics, Guns, government","Shopping, coffee, buying guides, kitchen","laptops, Computers, buying guides, Shopping, Windows, macbook, Chromebooks, Windows PCs","Shopping, smart home, buying guides, household, how-to, security","Shopping, review, Bicycles, outdoors, cycling, electric bikes, Reviews","kitchen, Shopping, buying guides, grills","TV, streaming, Amazon, Culture Guides","security roundup, security, cybersecurity, hacking, privacy, national security, immigration, politics","Shopping, productivity, buying guides, Paper, back to school","Gear Roundup, Shopping, fujifilm, qualcomm, Bose, Sonos","Climate Desk, science, environment, Energy, wildfires, California","Amazon Prime, Shopping, how-to, buying guides, Amazon, Amazon Prime Day","Waymo, protests, Autonomous Cars, Cities, los angeles, Self-Driving Cars, Alphabet","immigration, protests, surveillance, Military, politics, privacy, Homeland Security, Freedom of Information Act","Uncanny Valley Podcast, politics, News, immigration, protests","immigration, protests, military tech, politics, free speech, Police, national security","EVs and Hybrids, environment, Policy, Electric Vehicles, air quality, California","Shopping, laptops, tablets, apple, buying guides, Computers, Windows, Chromebooks","Bags, Travel, Air Travel, Shopping, buying guides, Accessories and Peripherals","Military, National Affairs, Donald Trump, surveillance, Police, protests","Shopping, gift guides, Teens","Travel, Bags, Shopping, buying guides, outdoors","kitchen, Shopping, Food and Drink, cooking, Cooking and Recipes, household","Headphones, audio, Shopping, Dyson"]},{"title":"This Chatbot Tool Pays Users $50 a Month for Their Feedback on AI Models","description":"On Yupp, chatbot users earn cash by saying which of two prompts they prefer—info that has great value to the AI companies running the models.","link":"https://www.wired.com/story/yupp-chatbot-pays-users-ai-model-feedback/","body":"\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eTo show off\u003c/span\u003e  how easy it is for users to earn money by using his new  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/tag/chatbots/' class='link'\u003echatbot\u003c/a\u003e  platform, Pankaj Gupta offers to cash out $1 worth of Yupp credits, sending it to me over Venmo or PayPal.

Yupp routes prompts to a pair of large language models, choosing from a pool of over 500 models that includes products from leading US generative AI companies like OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic, as well as international releases, like models from Alibaba, DeepSeek, and Mistral.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter looking over the two answers, users pick the response they like best, then provide feedback explaining why.

AI agents are buzzy right now; they’re basically task-based AI programs that can perform a string of simple operations on your behalf when given a single prompt.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe output based on Perplexity’s model answered the question citing five online sources, including CBS News and a  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/tag/youtube/' class='link'\u003eYouTube\u003c/a\u003e  video uploaded by the White House titled “Third-World Insurrection Riots on American Soil.” The other answer, generated by the news agent, cited twice as many sources, including the socialist magazine Jacobin and MSNBC.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn addition to having more sources, the answer on the right side included more context about what Los Angeles mayor Karen Bass has been doing.

I got a measly 68 credits for that feedback, not exactly a windfall. But since I spent 50 credits to run the prompt, it put me up by 18 credits.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter about an hour of messaging with the chatbot about different topics and giving my feedback on the models, the total points accrued equaled about $4. The cash-out options include PayPal and Venmo, but also cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. “Crypto and stablecoin allow us to instantly reach anywhere in the world,” Gupta says.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile I didn’t earn much money, the free outputs did include answers generated by newly released models that are often locked behind subscription paywalls.

It doesn\u0026#39;t currently have any deals with AI model builders and provides these responses by making API calls.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEvery time someone uses Yupp they are participating in a head-to-head comparison of two chatbot models and sometimes getting a reward for providing their feedback and picking a winning answer. Basically, it’s a user survey disguised as a fun game. (The website has  \u003cem class='italic'\u003elots\u003c/em\u003e  of emoji.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe sees the data trade-off in this situation for users as more explicit than past consumer apps, like Twitter—which he’s quick to tell me that he was the 27th employee at and now has one of that company’s cofounders, Biz Stone, as one of his backers. “This is a little bit of a departure from previous consumer companies,” he says. “You provide feedback data, that data is going to be used in an anonymized way and sent to the model builders.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhich brings us to where the real money is at: Selling human feedback to AI companies that desperately want more data to fine-tune their models.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Crowdsourced human evaluations is what we’re doing here,” Gupta says. He estimates the amount of cash users can make will add up to enough for a few cups of coffee a month. Though, this kind of data labeling, often called  \u003ca href='https://huggingface.co/blog/rlhf' class='link'\u003ereinforcement learning with human feedback\u003c/a\u003e  in the AI industry, is extremely valuable for companies as they release iterative models and fine tune the outputs. It’s worth far more than the bougiest cup of coffee in all of San Francisco.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe main competitor to Yupp is a website called  \u003ca href='https://lmarena.ai/' class='link'\u003eLMArena\u003c/a\u003e , which is quite popular with AI insiders for getting feedback on new models and bragging rights if a new release rises to the top of the pack. Whenever a powerful model is added to LMArena, it often stokes rumors about which major company is trying to test its new release in stealth.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“This is a two-sided product with network effects of consumers helping the model builders,” Gupta says. “And model builders, hopefully, are improving the models and submitting them back to the consumers.” He shows me a beta version of Yupp’s leaderboard, which goes live today and includes an overall ranking of the models alongside more granular data. The rankings can be filtered by how well a model performs with specific demographic information users share during the sign-up process, like their age, or on a particular prompt category, like health-care-related questions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNear the end of our conversation, Gupta brings up  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/what-is-artificial-general-intelligence-agi-explained/' class='link'\u003eartificial general intelligence\u003c/a\u003e —the theory of superintelligent, humanlike algorithms—as a technology that is imminent. “These models are being built for human users at the end of the day, at least for the near future,” he says. It’s a fairly common belief, and marketing point, among people working at AI companies, despite many researchers still questioning whether the underlying technology behind large language models will ever be able to produce AGI.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGupta wants Yupp users, who may be anxious about the future of humanity, to envision themselves as actively shaping these algorithms and improving their quality. “It’s better than free, because you are doing this great thing for AI\u0026#39;s future,” he says. “Now, some people would want to know that, and others just want the best answers.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd even more users might just want extra cash and be willing to spend a few hours giving feedback during their chatbot conversations.

I mean, it sounds great for summer—just like a blanket that warms you up but in reverse.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSadly, these products don’t do what they claim. They might be breathable so they don’t make you as hot as an ordinary blanket would, but you’d still be cooler with no blanket at all. However, there is hope. Someone has created a  \u003cem class='italic'\u003ereal\u003c/em\u003e  cooling blanket that\u0026#39;s sort of awesome.

In chemistry it’s the average kinetic energy, or vibrational motion, of the molecules in a substance. The greater the commotion, the higher the temperature.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut I like this more pragmatic definition: Temperature is the property two objects will have in common when they’re in contact for a long time. So, if you take a hot block of metal and set it against a cold block of metal, eventually they will have the same temperature. Heat flows from the warmer thing to the cooler thing until they equalize. (Note: It doesn’t work the other way around; you can’t transfer “coolness.”)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe also talk about objects having a certain amount of  \u003cem class='italic'\u003ethermal energy\u003c/em\u003e , which you’d get by adding up the kinetic energy of all the particles inside it. It depends on three things: the mass of the object, its temperature, and the material it’s made of. So for instance, focusing on mass, big potatoes have more thermal energy than small potatoes at the same temperature.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow, if you look at the type of material, every substance has a “specific heat capacity,” which is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of that substance by one degree. Try this at home. Find two objects that have been sitting in your room for a while, so they’re both at room temperature.

When your hand touches an object, there is a heat conduction interaction. Energy is transferred from your warmer hand to the cooler object until the two are the same temperature. However, with the metal block it takes way more energy to reach the temperature of your hand. It feels cooler because it causes your hand to lose more energy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou’ll notice the same thing when you go swimming. An air temperature of 75°F feels nice and comfortable, but wading into water of the same temperature feels really cold. That\u0026#39;s because water has a much higher mass and specific heat capacity than air, which causes you to lose more thermal energy and feel colder.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 class='text-xl font-semibold'\u003eAll Blankets Cool\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo, blankets, how do they work? A blanket is basically an insulator. That means it prevents energy transfer between objects at different temperatures. Wrapping yourself in a blanket on a cold day keeps you from losing body heat to the air around you, so you feel warmer. Similarly, if you put a blanket around a cold soda on a warm day, it will slow down the transfer of thermal energy from the air to the soda, keeping the soda  \u003cem class='italic'\u003ecold\u003c/em\u003e  longer.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut what if you feel hot and you put on a blanket? In that case, two things can happen at once. It can still act as a thermal insulator and slow down the transfer of energy between you and the air. Unless the ambient air is above 98.5°F, this is going to make you hotter, not cooler.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, the blanket can also have a thermal interaction with your body. Suppose you have a 80°F blanket in contact with a 98°F person. This will raise the temperature of the blanket while reducing the thermal energy of your body. Yes, it will act as a cooling blanket—at least for a few minutes, until the temperatures are equalized.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo, what makes one blanket cool more effectively than another? First, it should have a high mass, so that it takes a lot of energy to warm up. Second, the blanket needs to make good contact with your skin to increase the thermal interaction. So, one of those light fluffy blankets won\u0026#39;t cool you off that much. Other than that, it\u0026#39;s just a normal blanket.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut I\u0026#39;m a sucker for trying these things, so I bought a cheap “cooling blanket” online. (I know, someone will say it doesn\u0026#39;t work unless you get an expensive one.) For those who say their cooling blanket was out in the sun and they measured a 75°F temperature, I don\u0026#39;t believe you. Check this out. I have three blankets on my sofa. One of them is the cooling blanket and the others are normal.

Imagine I take a beaker with frozen water (aka ice) that\u0026#39;s colder than the freezing point (maybe –10°C). Then I put the beaker on a hot plate and add energy to it, measuring the temperature of the water as I go.

Why is that? It’s because the energy is being used to break the molecular bonds and turn the solid into a liquid. Once it’s entirely liquid, the temperature starts rising again—until it reaches the boiling point (100°C). Again, the temperature levels off until all the water turns to gas. (This is why it\u0026#39;s nice to cook with boiling water—it stays the same temperature.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou can see how this would make for a better cooling blanket.

The spacing and depth of the face buttons are tailored to the new size; shoulder buttons are longer; and there\u0026#39;s a smoother curve to the casing where each one sits in your palm. Meanwhile, the SL and SR buttons—the integrated shoulder buttons on the inner ridges for when a Joy-Con is being used as a single controller—are actually prominent enough to be useful now.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen attached to the central Switch 2 console, the magnetic connection feels far more robust than I\u0026#39;d expected. There\u0026#39;s a tiny bit of give by design, mere micrometers of movement that reduce leverage and help prevent damage or accidental detachment. There seems to be little chance of tearing a Joy-Con 2 off by mistake. Instead, a new trigger must be deliberately squeezed to force the controller away from the console. This is cleverly positioned to be easily accessible from above but almost impossible to snag in the middle of a game.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class='AssetEmbedWrapper-eVDQiB byBkf asset-embed'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cpicture class='ResponsiveImagePicture-cWuUZO dUOtEa AssetEmbedResponsiveAsset-cXBNxi lqMXz asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image'\u003e\u003cimg src='https://media.wired.com/photos/684bfe06cdd26dec88f8cdd1/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/DSC_4310.jpg' alt='Image may contain Electronics Remote Control Baby and Person'\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003ePhotograph: Julian Chokkattu\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eLike the original Joy-Cons, there\u0026#39;s an array of miniature technical marvels crammed into both grips, although most features are, like so much of the Switch 2 as a whole, largely iterating on what came before. Motion tracking controls remain solid, while the haptic feedback—dubbed HD Rumble 2—is significantly enhanced. It responds quicker to prompts from a game and is capable of more nuanced sensations. They can even vibrate fast enough to become ersatz speakers, able to pump out high pitched sound effects from the controllers themselves. Practical utility? Near zero. Tech flex points?

If you opt for system transfer, it\u0026#39;s easiest to do so with both consoles in handheld mode as there\u0026#39;s a fair bit of menu hopping, but note that both units need to be plugged in.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt seems clear Nintendo wants existing users to move wholesale to the Switch 2, but I suspect many will keep their earlier console for a while, purely because of storage woes.

Activated by tapping the new C button on the right-hand Joy-Con 2 or the Pro Controller, GameChat connects up to four online friends for voice or video calls. The console itself has a built-in microphone, which proves astonishingly good at picking up your voice whether playing in TV, tabletop, or handheld mode.

If you do need a phone for coordination or as a way to call friends or a lawyer in case of an emergency, keep it off as much as possible to reduce the chances that it connects to a rogue cell tower or Wi-Fi hot spot being used by law enforcement for surveillance. Sort out logistics with friends in advance so you only need to turn your phone on if something goes awry. Or to be even more certain that your phone won’t be tracked, keep it in a Faraday bag that blocks all of its radio communications. Open the bag only when necessary. Holmes herself uses and recommends the  \u003ca href='https://mosequipment.com/products/mission-darkness-small-window-faraday-bag?variant=10642588229' class='link'\u003eMission Darkness Faraday bag\u003c/a\u003e .\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you do need a mobile device, consider bringing only a secondary phone you don’t use often, or a  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-use-burner-phone/' class='link'\u003eburner\u003c/a\u003e . Your main smartphone likely has the majority of your digital accounts and data on it, all of which law enforcement could conceivably access if they confiscate your phone. But don’t assume that any backup phone you buy will grant you anonymity. If you give a prepaid carrier your identifying details, after all, your “burner” phone could be no more anonymous than your primary device. “Don’t expect because you got it from Duane Reade that you’re automatically a character from  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eThe Wire\u003c/em\u003e ,” Holmes cautions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eInstead of a burner phone, Holmes argues that it may be far more practical to simply own a secondary phone that you’ve set up to be less sensitive—leaving off accounts and apps that offer your most private information to anyone who seizes it, such as social media, email, and messaging apps. “Choosing a secondary device that limits the amount of personal data that you have on you at all times is probably your best protection,” Holmes says.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRegardless of what phone you’re using, consider that traditional calls and text messages are vulnerable to surveillance. That means you need to use end-to-end encryption. Ideally, you and those you communicate with should use disappearing messages set to self-delete after a few hours or days. The encrypted messaging and calling app  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/signal-tips-private-messaging-encryption/' class='link'\u003eSignal\u003c/a\u003e  has  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/signal-encrypted-messaging-features-mainstream/' class='link'\u003eperhaps the best and longest track record\u003c/a\u003e . Just make sure you and the people you’re communicating with are using the same app, since they’re not interoperable.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAside from protecting your phone’s communications from surveillance, be prepared in the event police seize your device and try to unlock it in search of incriminating evidence. The first order of business is to make sure your smartphone’s contents are encrypted. iOS devices have full disk encryption on by default if you enable an access lock. For Android phones, go to  \u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eSettings\u003c/strong\u003e , then  \u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eSecurity\u003c/strong\u003e  to make sure the  \u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eEncrypt Disk\u003c/strong\u003e  option is turned on. (These steps may differ depending on your specific device.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRegardless of your operating system, always protect devices with a long, strong passcode rather than a fingerprint or face unlock. As convenient as biometric unlocking methods are, it may be more difficult to resist an officer forcing your thumb onto your phone’s sensor, for instance, than to refuse to tell them a passcode. So if you use biometrics day-to-day for convenience, disable them before heading into a protest.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you insist on using biometric unlocking methods to have faster access to your devices, keep in mind that some phones have an emergency function to disable these types of locks. Hold the wake button and one of the volume buttons simultaneously on an iPhone, for instance, and it will lock itself and require a passcode to unlock rather than FaceID or TouchID, even if they’re enabled. Most devices also let you take photos or record video without unlocking them first, a good way to keep your phone locked as much as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 class='text-xl font-semibold'\u003eYour Face\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eFace recognition has become one of the most powerful tools to identify your presence at a protest. Consider wearing a face mask and sunglasses to make it far more difficult for you to be identified by face recognition in surveillance footage or social media photos or videos of the protest. Fight for the Future’s Greer cautions, however, that the accuracy of the most effective face recognition tools available to law enforcement remains something of an unknown, and a simple surgical mask or KN95 may no longer be enough to defeat well-honed face-tracking tech.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cpicture class='ResponsiveImagePicture-cWuUZO dUOtEa responsive-image'\u003e\u003cimg src='https://media.wired.com/photos/592681c8cfe0d93c47430734/master/w_775%2Cc_limit/Inauguration_Trump_1556.jpg' alt='This image may contain Human, Person, Parade, Protest, Crowd, Martín Barba, and Yoshitaka Amano' class='mt-4 p-2 max-w-full h-auto rounded shadow-sm'\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003ca href='/2017/01/use-social-media-protest-without-big-brother-snooping/' class='link'\u003eHow to Use Social Media at a Protest Without Big Brother Snooping\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan\u003eBy \u003c/span\u003e\u003ca href='/author/lily-hay-newman/' class='link'\u003eLily Hay Newman\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you’re serious about not being identified, she says, a full-face mask may be far safer—or even a Halloween-style one. “I\u0026#39;ve seen people wear funny cosplay-style cartoon masks or mascot suits or silly costumes,” says Greer, offering as an example  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/tag/donald-trump/' class='link'\u003eDonald Trump\u003c/a\u003e  and  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/tag/elon-musk/' class='link'\u003eElon Musk\u003c/a\u003e  masks that she’s seen protesters wear at  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/musk-trump-breakup-tesla-stock-price/' class='link'\u003eTesla Takedown protests\u003c/a\u003e  against Musk and the so-called  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-digital-coup-doge-data-ai/' class='link'\u003eDepartment of Government Efficiency\u003c/a\u003e  ( \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/tag/doge/' class='link'\u003eDOGE\u003c/a\u003e ). “That\u0026#39;s a great way to defy facial recognition and also make the protest more fun.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou should also consider the clothes you’re wearing before you head out.

For those of you in the most sensitive positions—such as undocumented immigrants at risk of deportation—she suggests that you consider staying home rather than depend on any obfuscation technique to mask their presence at an event.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you’re driving a car to a protest—your own or someone else’s—consider that  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/license-plate-reader-live-video-data-exposed/' class='link'\u003eautomatic license plate readers\u003c/a\u003e  can easily identify the vehicle’s movements.

Now things have changed.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 class='text-xl font-semibold'\u003eYour Online Footprint\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThough most privacy and security considerations for attending an in-person protest naturally relate to your body, any devices you bring with you, and your physical surroundings, there are a set of other factors to think about online. It’s important to understand how posts on social media and other platforms before, during, or after a protest could be collected and used by authorities to identify and track you or others. Simply saying on an online platform that you are attending or attended a protest puts the information out there. And if you take photos or videos during a protest, that content could be used to expand law enforcement’s view of who attended a protest and what they did while there, including any strangers who appear in your images or footage.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAuthorities can come to your online presence by looking for information about you in particular, but can also arrive there using bulk data analysis tools like Dataminr that offer law enforcement and other customers real-time monitoring connecting people to their online activity. Such tools can also surface past posts, and if you’ve ever made violent comments online or alluded to committing crimes—even as a joke—law enforcement could discover the activity and use it against you if you are questioned or arrested during a protest. This is a particular concern for people living in the US on visas or those whose immigration status is tenuous. The US State Department has  \u003ca href='https://www.uscis.gov/newsroom/news-releases/dhs-to-begin-screening-aliens-social-media-activity-for-antisemitism' class='link'\u003esaid explicitly\u003c/a\u003e  that it is monitoring immigrants’ and travelers’ social media activity.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn addition to written posts, keep in mind that files you upload to social media might contain metadata like time stamps and location information that could help authorities track protest crowds and movement. Make sure you have permission to photograph or videotape any fellow protesters who would be potentially identifiable in your content. Also think carefully before livestreaming. It’s important to document what’s going on but difficult to be sure that everyone who could show up in your stream is comfortable being included.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEven if you take photos and videos that you don’t plan to post on social media or otherwise share, remember that this media could fall into law enforcement’s hands if they demand access to your device.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith federal crackdowns on protests ramping up around the country, Cyberlixir’s Vo says that people must assess each situation and weigh the benefits of maintaining personal privacy versus chronicling the reality of what’s happening at protests.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Social media monitoring and online profiling is the factor that lots of people forget. Those who publish footage on social media should avoid sharing photos or videos that reveal people\u0026#39;s faces,” she says. “But I also believe that documenting what’s going on is essential, especially in high-risk conditions, because when the state escalates we need proof for legal defense, for public record, for future organizing, and also to keep ourselves physically safe in real time.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs protests continue—with the real possibility of even further escalated response from the Trump administration—be prepared for the emergence of forms of digital surveillance that have never been used in the US before to counter civil disobedience or to retaliate against protesters after the fact. Protesters will need to stay vigilant, and Fight for the Future’s Greer emphasizes that everyone has different potential vulnerabilities and tolerance for risk. For people of every category of risk, however, a few thoughtful privacy protections can go a long way towards empowering them to hit the streets.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Part of the goal of governments extending and implementing mass surveillance programs is to scare people and make people think twice before they speak up,” Greer says. “I think that we should be very careful in this moment not to fall into that trap.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","publishedAt":"2025-06-12T19:29:20Z","categories":["Security","Security / Security Advice","Voicing Concerns"],"keywords":["Shopping, buying guides, birds, outdoor, smart home","Shopping, buying guides, TVs, home entertainment, 4K","review, mattresses, Shopping, online shopping, Reviews, household","Quanta Magazine, space, science, Jupiter, volcanoes, NASA, satellite images","video games, Playstation, Sony, COVID-19, Console Games","laptops, Shopping, how-to, Computers, Windows, PCs, operating systems","extremism, law enforcement, politics, Guns, government","Shopping, coffee, buying guides, kitchen","laptops, Computers, buying guides, Shopping, Windows, macbook, Chromebooks, Windows PCs","Shopping, smart home, buying guides, household, how-to, security","Shopping, review, Bicycles, outdoors, cycling, electric bikes, Reviews","kitchen, Shopping, buying guides, grills","TV, streaming, Amazon, Culture Guides","security roundup, security, cybersecurity, hacking, privacy, national security, immigration, politics","Shopping, productivity, buying guides, Paper, back to school","Gear Roundup, Shopping, fujifilm, qualcomm, Bose, Sonos","Climate Desk, science, environment, Energy, wildfires, California","Amazon Prime, Shopping, how-to, buying guides, Amazon, Amazon Prime Day","Waymo, protests, Autonomous Cars, Cities, los angeles, Self-Driving Cars, Alphabet","immigration, protests, surveillance, Military, politics, privacy, Homeland Security, Freedom of Information Act","Uncanny Valley Podcast, politics, News, immigration, protests","immigration, protests, military tech, politics, free speech, Police, national security","EVs and Hybrids, environment, Policy, Electric Vehicles, air quality, California","Shopping, laptops, tablets, apple, buying guides, Computers, Windows, Chromebooks","Bags, Travel, Air Travel, Shopping, buying guides, Accessories and Peripherals","Military, National Affairs, Donald Trump, surveillance, Police, protests","Shopping, gift guides, Teens","Travel, Bags, Shopping, buying guides, outdoors","kitchen, Shopping, Food and Drink, cooking, Cooking and Recipes, household","Headphones, audio, Shopping, Dyson","ai, chatbots, ChatGPT, Startups, artificial intelligence","physics, Energy, Dot Physics, thermodynamics","mattresses, how-to, Shopping, online shopping, household, Sleep","Nintendo, video games, Console Games, review, consoles","video games, phones, portable gaming, iPhone, Android, mobile games, smartphone, buying guides, Apps, Shopping, ios","science, space, China, Spacecraft, Asteroids","coupons, Shopping","coupons, Shopping","Meta, data privacy, artificial intelligence, software, chatbots","surveillance, privacy, Cellphones, law enforcement, encryption, protests"]},{"title":"The 35 Best Movies on Max (aka HBO Max) Right Now (June 2025)","description":"Mountainhead, Babygirl, and The Brutalist are just a few of the movies you should be watching on Max this month.","link":"https://www.wired.com/story/best-movies-hbo-max-right-now/","body":"\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAs the birthplace\u003c/span\u003e  of prestige TV shows like  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/2014/08/binge-guide-the-sopranos/' class='link'\u003e\u003cem class='italic'\u003eThe Sopranos\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e  and  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/2014/07/binge-guide-the-wire/' class='link'\u003e\u003cem class='italic'\u003eThe Wire\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e , HBO—and, by extension,  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/story/hbo-max-discovery-plus-combined/' class='link'\u003eHBO Max\u003c/a\u003e —is best known for its impressive lineup of original series.

The concert, which attracted an estimated 300,000 people to California’s Altamont Speedway on December 6, 1969, was a disaster from the get-go—especially given the band’s decision to bring in the Hells Angels as the show’s security (one member famously said they were reportedly paid in beer). The Stones weren’t the only artists, but by the time they took the stage the crowd was out of control. At one point, one of the Angels stabbed a man, Meredith Hunter, right in front of the stage—a moment that the filmmakers later realized they had captured on film.

That becomes a bit of a challenge when he’s put on the jury of a high-profile murder trial … only to realize that he may have inadvertently played a part in what happened.

Höss lives right next door to the camp, in the so-called Zone of Interest, with his wife Hedwig (Sandra Hüller) and their five children. Within those four walls, they strive to build a dream life for their family—while the sound of gunshots, incoming trains, and furnaces being lit are just a part of daily life.

That was an early version of this. It came out around 2018; we wrote about it at the time at WIRED. But I tried to make a dinner reservation recently at that place that you and I went to for your birthday. Vegan sushi. Already, this is the most San Francisco podcast ever. We\u0026#39;re talking about vegan sushi and how I dispatched, unknowingly, an AI agent to try to make the reservation for me.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eMichael Calore:\u003c/strong\u003e  How was it unknowingly?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eLauren Goode:\u003c/strong\u003e  Because I just did the very human thing where I went to a website and typed in \u0026#34;would like to make a reservation for this number of people at this time.\u0026#34; Unbeknownst to me, it funneled it through the Google Assistant. Then it said, “We are trying the restaurant on your behalf.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eMichael Calore:\u003c/strong\u003e  Oh.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eLauren Goode:\u003c/strong\u003e  And it kept trying, and then it would send me a notification. Then it kept trying, and it would send me a notification. It was working behind the scenes to try to make a reservation. It did not successfully complete the reservation. Does that count?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eMichael Calore:\u003c/strong\u003e  Yeah, that fully counts.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eLauren Goode:\u003c/strong\u003e  That\u0026#39;s an AI agent? It was working on my behalf.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eMichael Calore:\u003c/strong\u003e  Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eLauren Goode:\u003c/strong\u003e  Will, what about you?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eWill Knight:\u003c/strong\u003e  I\u0026#39;ve been playing with AI coding tools, and primarily Claude Code, which is I think a good example of an agent. Because it does all these fun things, like not just writes code, but it edits files, moves them around. Uses your terminal. Deletes stuff if you\u0026#39;re unlucky. That\u0026#39;s the agentic thing I\u0026#39;ve been playing with.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eLauren Goode:\u003c/strong\u003e  You\u0026#39;ve been vibe coding is what you\u0026#39;re saying.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eWill Knight:\u003c/strong\u003e  I have, yeah. It\u0026#39;s been fascinating. Vibe coding is this term that a very well-known AI researcher, Andrej Karpathy, came up with to describe basically conjuring up whole programs, finished software, just by prompting a model. These models have always been able to auto-complete code, but they\u0026#39;ve gotten so good in the last year at coding that they can create whole projects involving lots of files and lots of folders, and everything. Actually, I started off doing it with my kid because I thought, \u0026#34;How do you teach a kid to make sense of AI?\u0026#34; And also, you\u0026#39;ve always thought it\u0026#39;s a good idea to get them to code. He loves games, so I thought, \u0026#34;Let\u0026#39;s code some games.\u0026#34;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eMichael Calore:\u003c/strong\u003e  Well, my experience is far less technical, because I recently had to make a change to a plane reservation through the Southwest app.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eLauren Goode:\u003c/strong\u003e  I\u0026#39;m sorry.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eMichael Calore:\u003c/strong\u003e  Yeah. Well, it was actually fine.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eLauren Goode:\u003c/strong\u003e  My condolences.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eMichael Calore:\u003c/strong\u003e  It pushed me to the chatbot. It was like \u0026#34;talk to our chatbot if you need help. I was like, \u0026#34;Oh, this is going to be infuriating.\u0026#34; Actually, it was fine. It took five minutes. I gave it my confirmation number, my flight information. Then it said, \u0026#34;What change would you like to make?\u0026#34; I said, \u0026#34;I would like to do this.\u0026#34; They said, \u0026#34;We can do this for you with no fee.\u0026#34; I was like, \u0026#34;Great.\u0026#34; \u0026#34;Do you want to book it?\u0026#34; Yes. “OK, it\u0026#39;s booked. Here\u0026#39;s your new boarding pass. You need to check in, but here\u0026#39;s the link to check in and get your new boarding pass.\u0026#34; I was like, \u0026#34;Wow.\u0026#34;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eLauren Goode:\u003c/strong\u003e  Is that the agent we\u0026#39;re talking about? That\u0026#39;s a customer service agent.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eMichael Calore:\u003c/strong\u003e  Right.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eLauren Goode:\u003c/strong\u003e  And it\u0026#39;s a bot replicating that. But this new era of agentic AI, tech companies raising millions of dollars and having valuations in the billions because they\u0026#39;re pivoting to agents, that\u0026#39;s not exactly what that is though, right?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eMichael Calore:\u003c/strong\u003e  Right. That\u0026#39;s a good question for Will. Can we throw this one to you, Will? What\u0026#39;s the difference between an AI agent what we\u0026#39;re talking about and a traditional chatbot, which most people have experienced?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eWill Knight:\u003c/strong\u003e  Right. The chatbot generates text and you can communicate with it through that very, very narrow domain of text. That\u0026#39;s been extraordinarily powerful. The revolution we\u0026#39;ve seen is built around these language models which can produce extraordinarily coherent and good answers to questions, that isn\u0026#39;t quite the same as an AI system that is inherently an agent. If you go back in the history of AI, actually, a lot of researchers have always worked on this idea that intelligence inherently involves agency. Humans are not things that just speak. They try and perform actions, you try and solve problems. That\u0026#39;s been a longstanding goal. It\u0026#39;s a weird quirk that we had these language models, which are so limited and kind of old-fashioned. A lot of what we\u0026#39;re seeing when it comes to agents out there are basically people taking language models and using the fact that they\u0026#39;re very general and very flexible to take a complex command and trigger some actions. The real leap that companies want to make is that the models themselves will decide and be able to formulate their actions themselves, more like an intelligent entity.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eLauren Goode:\u003c/strong\u003e  The human is still in the loop, but the human puts in a command or a prompt and then steps back. The agent is doing a bunch of AI stuff, basically while you go do other things. That\u0026#39;s the promise, that they\u0026#39;re going to be able to make us all hyper-productive.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eWill Knight:\u003c/strong\u003e  Yeah. Ideally, you would have an agent that would call up the airline for you. You tell it what you want to do and it goes and does the negotiation for you. Or you can give it much more open-ended commands or what you\u0026#39;re trying to achieve and it figures out how to do it for you. The language models are so general, so capable that in theory, they ought to be able to do that. But there are some really key catches when it comes to how you try and replicate human agency, because there\u0026#39;s a lot more going on in the world than just language. Agency actually involves more than just trying to solve an individual problem because it involves other people, which makes it complicated.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eMichael Calore:\u003c/strong\u003e  To say the least.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eWill Knight:\u003c/strong\u003e  Yes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eMichael Calore:\u003c/strong\u003e  Speaking of the models, it seems as though all of Silicon Valley has invested in developing their own AI agents, but who are the main players right now?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eWill Knight:\u003c/strong\u003e  The main players are the obvious ones. OpenAI, Anthropic, Google. I think Amazon is a good dark horse in this race. They hired some excels from OpenAI who made an agentic startup. They have a lab that they\u0026#39;re trying to build a lot of agents. One of the key things for these companies is where do you get the data from. They\u0026#39;re all desperately trying to figure out how you get data to train these agents. Instead of having just text, you want examples of things that people do. Amazon actually has quite a lot of good examples of that, of people doing stuff on its sites. They\u0026#39;re a good player.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eLauren Goode:\u003c/strong\u003e  Well, then in the coding world too, there are companies like Cursor. Tell us about that whole world, since you\u0026#39;ve been vibe coding with your son.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eWill Knight:\u003c/strong\u003e  Yeah. Yeah, there are a bunch of startups who\u0026#39;ve really ridden on the backs of the other AI companies, but really focused on coding. I think just because that\u0026#39;s moved so quickly, they\u0026#39;ve been able to carve out these niches. OpenAI is widely rumored to be looking to acquire one of these companies, Windsurf, for about three billion. Which gives you an indication of how they\u0026#39;ve been able to make this really great business for themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eLauren Goode:\u003c/strong\u003e  It seems like every briefing we are on these days, a company is talking about agents.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eMichael Calore:\u003c/strong\u003e  Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eLauren Goode:\u003c/strong\u003e  It ranges, too. It\u0026#39;s every company from Nvidia, to Microsoft, to well-funded startups. Even just earlier this week, a company called Glean, I\u0026#39;m pretty sure you guys have heard of it. It\u0026#39;s a company that has built a search engine for enterprise apps. They just raised 150 million in a series F round of funding. They are now valued at $7.2 billion. Their whole thing now is agents. It\u0026#39;s all about agents.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eWill Knight:\u003c/strong\u003e  I think the way to think about it is who is really building models that are trying to learn the general agency that you see in a language model, and that is OpenAI, these foundation model companies. You can go back to a previous era in AI when we had some of these game-playing AI systems, like AlphaZero. That used reinforcement learning, this process of experimenting. But it was fundamentally agentic. It only operates within a very limited world of a board game, but it\u0026#39;s taking actions, it\u0026#39;s figure out how to take those. What we\u0026#39;re seeing now with these AI companies mirrors that or is going back to that in a way, because they\u0026#39;re trying to get them to reason to a particular answer, to a particular end goal.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eMichael Calore:\u003c/strong\u003e  If we think about what role AI agents could play in the longterm, a lot of the companies that we\u0026#39;re talking about are starting with customer service. They\u0026#39;re starting with, OK, you have a simple question, you need something simple done. I can go figure that out for you, I can go accomplish that for you. I think that\u0026#39;s where most of the early strides are being made. Gartner, the tech market researcher, has put out an estimate that AI agents will resolve 80% of common customer service queries by the year 2029. That\u0026#39;s four years from now, AI agents will be doing all of our customer service stuff for us. Based on some of these examples that we\u0026#39;ve been talking about, it does seem like the automation of tasks currently performed by employees who are human is a common thread here.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eWill Knight:\u003c/strong\u003e  Yeah. I think the customer service is an obvious place to start because it involves taking what language models are brilliant at, which is talking to people and then trying to do a fairly limited number of things. A lot of these companies, the big AI players, are looking at going from coding to how you automate office work. There is a ton of repetitive tasks in office work. In theory, you could be able to use these models as the glue to figure out what someone\u0026#39;s trying to do and then replicate that. There\u0026#39;s already a huge amount of worry in the world of coding that this is going to eliminate lots of jobs. Then I think that there\u0026#39;s a good chance it\u0026#39;s going to come for much more routine white collar work as well.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eLauren Goode:\u003c/strong\u003e  Well, it\u0026#39;s been fun doing this podcast with you all.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eMichael Calore:\u003c/strong\u003e  We\u0026#39;ve mostly been focusing on how AI agents go out and do things, like surf the web, or call a restaurant, or fulfill some sort of task in a Microsoft Office product for you. But I\u0026#39;m curious about what the world of agentic AI looks like in our homes, on our physical devices. This has been at the top of a lot of people\u0026#39;s minds recently because OpenAI just announced that it made a deal with Jony Ive, the former and longtime head of design at Apple, to acquire a new startup that he launched to build a new class of AI devices for the home. How do we feel about this development?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eLauren Goode:\u003c/strong\u003e  It\u0026#39;s hard to say because we don\u0026#39;t know what form it\u0026#39;s going to take exactly yet. This is I think representative of a new generation of startups and hardware startups that are going to exist to serve these AIs. They\u0026#39;re built from the ground up with the future of artificial intelligence and ambient computing in mind. We don\u0026#39;t know exactly what form factor it\u0026#39;s going to take yet. Whether it\u0026#39;s going to be on your desktop, or it\u0026#39;s going to be on your body, or maybe both. Well, one, I do appreciate, I believe it was Jony Ive who said some version of, \u0026#34;We can all agree, we\u0026#39;re a little too attached to our iPhone.\u0026#34; The thing that they\u0026#39;ve invented is now, \u0026#34;We have to solve for the thing that we invented.\u0026#34; But the idea is can AI actually do enough so that it takes us away from having to be heads down or faces in screens all of the time, actually performing the actions? Can technology do some of that for us? And then free us up for other things. That\u0026#39;s always, in Silicon Valley, been one of promises of AI. I remember talking to Astro Teller from Google X years ago and asking him, \u0026#34;Well, what does this mean for jobs?\u0026#34; And him basically saying, \u0026#34;Well, with AI, people are just going to level up.\u0026#34; That\u0026#39;s always been a really sunny Silicon Valley optimistic view of AI. I think that there will be a new category of jobs and also tasks created that we haven\u0026#39;t maybe even thought of yet, but we still just have no idea how it\u0026#39;s actually going to work day-to-day into our lives.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eMichael Calore:\u003c/strong\u003e  Right. Because I feel like people have been trying this for a long time. Whenever we saw the demo for the next version of Siri, or the next version of Alexa, or the next version of Google Assistant, there was always a demo where they would ask the speaker, the voice-controlled smart speaker to order a pizza.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eLauren Goode:\u003c/strong\u003e  Yes, it was the pizza and the Uber, those were always the examples.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eMichael Calore:\u003c/strong\u003e  These are the deals that the device makers made with the businesses and they coded that in. When you ask Alexa, \u0026#34;Can you order a pizza,\u0026#34; it wasn\u0026#39;t calling Dominoes and Alexa\u0026#39;s voice ordering your pizza for you. It was just doing it on the web in an app, through an API basically. I think when you talk about what the next generation of that is, it\u0026#39;s you can ask it to do anything. What is that thing you\u0026#39;re asking? It\u0026#39;s some device that sits next to your computer and your phone? Why does it have to be a separate device? Why can it just be your computer and your phone is the big question that I have. Do we need something that\u0026#39;s going to probably cost several hundred dollars that\u0026#39;s probably going to be very beautiful that does a lot of what the other two devices that we already own do? I don\u0026#39;t really know. Everybody\u0026#39;s excited about it though because it\u0026#39;s Jony Ive and Sam Altman teamed up.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eLauren Goode:\u003c/strong\u003e  Right. It just becomes the delivery mechanism for whatever this new era of computing is. I do think too, the examples we\u0026#39;re talking about are very much a Wall-E kind of future. How lazy can we possibly be while we dispatch AI and machine learning to do the things for us? Whereas there\u0026#39;s also going to be space for how much more can I learn? What kind of knowledge can I obtain? What can I do differently because AI is helping me? There\u0026#39;s been this promise on the consumer end for a long time of this is going to change your day-to-day life by tapping into these small inconveniences that we have now. But I think the real gains stand to be, one, I don\u0026#39;t mean to sound too optimistic about this because I\u0026#39;m not entirely, but can we close gaps of knowledge because AI is actually going to help us do that in some way?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eWill Knight:\u003c/strong\u003e  Yeah. I think when it comes to OpenAI\u0026#39;s and Jony Ive thing, the models are getting increasingly really good at interpreting the visual world and interacting through speech. I think there\u0026#39;s this idea in the ethos that you can have completely new, a new interface, you can reimagine the interface entirely. You don\u0026#39;t have this graphical user interface. God knows what they\u0026#39;re going to come up. Google has demoed this with this Project Astra, where you wear these glasses and you can talk about what\u0026#39;s around you. I\u0026#39;ve tried that. It\u0026#39;s kind of impressive. Yeah, maybe there\u0026#39;s new ways you can order pizzas with it. But also, I can\u0026#39;t help thinking about the fact that they need the data for what people are doing increasingly to train these models as well. I feel like the hardware makers have so much interesting data. They don\u0026#39;t really tend to tap into it because of privacy issues, but maybe OpenAI will find a way. Then in the issue of how you train, the knowledge gap, I think that\u0026#39;s a really, really important point because automation often causes people\u0026#39;s skills to atrophy. You see it in autopilot in aircraft. Then you\u0026#39;re definitely seeing coders saying they\u0026#39;re losing skills because they rely too much on that. What does that mean for the workforce?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eLauren Goode:\u003c/strong\u003e  Right. If all of these AI agents free us up to do other things, what exactly are they going to free us up to do? How are we going to fill that time? In our ultra-capitalist, some people may call it end stage capitalist society, the answer is probably, \u0026#34;Well, you can just be more productive. You can just do more, more, more.\u0026#34; I think it\u0026#39;s going to be up to us, the humans, to push back against that and say, \u0026#34;Here\u0026#39;s how we actually want to fill our time.\u0026#34; There are also going to be these little bottlenecks for a while that I think are going to make these more complicated than anything else. When I was at Google IO a few weeks ago, I got a demo, Will, of their Project Mariner. Have you seen this yet?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eWill Knight:\u003c/strong\u003e  Yeah, I\u0026#39;ve tried that. Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eLauren Goode:\u003c/strong\u003e  You have tried it? I don\u0026#39;t know if this was the demo they gave you, but the experience I saw, it scanned a cocktail recipe. Then it automatically just grabbed the ingredients from the cocktail and put it in an Instacart shopping cart. But then, it hit a bottleneck because there was no authentication for the Instacart account. It was like, \u0026#34;Oh, hold on, we have to log in.\u0026#34; Then some demo-er was trying to log into Instacart. \u0026#34;But look, it\u0026#39;s so seamless.\u0026#34; I\u0026#39;m like, \u0026#34;No, I literally could have just added that to Instacart.\u0026#34;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eWill Knight:\u003c/strong\u003e  Yeah. Their examples always seem to involve buying something for some reason.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eMichael Calore:\u003c/strong\u003e  Why do we think that there is such a laser focus on AI agents at the moment in Silicon Valley? Is it the Valley\u0026#39;s tendency to always just need a new goal to race towards? Is it indicative of something larger? Is it what VCs are most interested in funding? What\u0026#39;s the reason here?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eWill Knight:\u003c/strong\u003e  From my perspective, one of the main reasons is that, going back to the history of AI, this is really the next step you would take in building something that\u0026#39;s getting closer to human-like AI or AGI, or whatever you want to call it. A lot of researchers are very interested in doing that. I think there is also a ton of potential. Chatting to a chatbot is useful if you want to do lots of things, answer lots of questions. But the idea that you could automate a lot of work or mundane chores is potentially valuable.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eLauren Goode:\u003c/strong\u003e  Yeah. I think that if you\u0026#39;re on the startup side of things, this is where the money is flowing right now. We\u0026#39;ve been in this era for a while where interest rates are really high. For some startups, it hasn\u0026#39;t been easy to raise capital. There\u0026#39;s been a bit of a pause on the IPO market that has cooled a bit. Although, now there\u0026#39;s signs that it\u0026#39;s picking up again. I think the threat of tariffs still looming over people\u0026#39;s heads in Silicon Valley. If you\u0026#39;ve been iterating on your software, and suddenly you can say to your would-be investors, \u0026#34;But, wait. We\u0026#39;re pivoting to agents. We\u0026#39;re doing this agentic AI. We\u0026#39;re going to be able to sell this software into other businesses, and also we\u0026#39;re going to streamline our own processes and reduce our own overhead costs.\u0026#34; It\u0026#39;s probably a path to raising right now. Is some of it hype? Sure, it is. But as Will is saying, because, Will, you\u0026#39;re so steeped in the research and development side of this, actually there\u0026#39;s some pretty notable advancements being made, too.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eMichael Calore:\u003c/strong\u003e  Let\u0026#39;s take a break right now, and we\u0026#39;ll come right back. The development of agents is going forward full-throttle, but as we were just talking about, the current agents that we\u0026#39;re able to use have some significant limitations. But quickly, what are some of the other concerns behind the growth of AI agents? Not just about usability, but about the other things that they do.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eLauren Goode:\u003c/strong\u003e  Well, I think reliability is certainly one issue because they\u0026#39;re still subject to the same kind of hallucinations, and errors, and even sycophancy that the LLMs are. You\u0026#39;re also introducing much more complex queries into it because you\u0026#39;re not just asking it to run a search for you. You\u0026#39;re asking it to perform multiple steps under certain conditions. There are also concerns around high cost in compute power. Then there\u0026#39;s selling the product itself. The Information recently reported that OpenAI might charge up to $20,000 per month for some of its more specialized AI agents. Supposedly, these are agents that would be able to perform at the level of expertise of a PhD graduate, supposedly. On the one hand, that\u0026#39;s really, really expensive. On the other hand, our colleague Paresh Dave has been reporting how some people in the industry believe that\u0026#39;s actually not that much money. Because ultimately, if these agents replace jobs, which is what they might do, then you\u0026#39;re saving on all of those salary costs. It might actually be something of a bargain. Right now though, there\u0026#39;s a bit of sticker shock around that.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eWill Knight:\u003c/strong\u003e  Yeah, I think that\u0026#39;s very true. There are a bunch of other issues, things that could go wrong and probably will go wrong. A bunch of researchers that I spoke to ... I spoke to Zico Kolter at CMU who is also on the board of OpenAI who\u0026#39;s been looking at the security of agents, and just introducing agents that are going to, ideally in future, interact with other agents. You have this amplifying effect that could be very difficult to predict. As Lauren says, also the idea of these things buying things inherently makes them a much juicier target for hackers. If you have something like Mariner using the web, it\u0026#39;s really interesting just to think about the idea that people will maybe try and reinvent SEO to work for agents. One of the more fundamental problems I think is that these aren\u0026#39;t really actually replicating human agency. There\u0026#39;s a really interesting book on this, to go into the weeds, called The Evolution of Agency. Where if you look at animals and how their agency has evolved, when you get to humans, there\u0026#39;s a very fundamental difference in the way human agency works and it involves working with other humans. It involves collaborating and knowing that you often have to sacrifice things to work together. You have things like guilt, you have empathy that evolved. These models, we\u0026#39;re seeing examples of models doing really crazy things in contrived examples, where they\u0026#39;re told they\u0026#39;re going to be switched off and then they\u0026#39;ll blackmail someone. That is not actually necessarily an example of an evil model, it could be just an example of a model that hasn\u0026#39;t learned how we\u0026#39;d expect a person to behave all the time. Yeah, that could have a lot of unforeseen consequences.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eMichael Calore:\u003c/strong\u003e  I think my biggest concern is something that you touched on, Lauren, which is the fact that, as the hype and the excitement around AI agents ramps up, that a lot of companies are going to be looking at them as a way to reduce labor costs. There\u0026#39;s nothing inherently wrong about reducing labor costs, but I feel like there is something inherently wrong about replacing an entire class of workers at a company with machines. It is quite literally dehumanizing. And I mean that not only in the jokey sense that you\u0026#39;re getting rid of humans, but also just that the people working there and the customers that are interacting with your company are now going to feel alienated from you because they no longer have that human interaction that they\u0026#39;re used to. We\u0026#39;re already seeing that happening. That\u0026#39;s the kind of thing that excites people who are very concerned about the bottom line, and worries people who are concerned about things income and equality, and all the problems that come along with this rampant push towards mechanization. We\u0026#39;ve been dealing with this as a society for 150 years, and I feel like as the technology gets more powerful, that those worries just accelerate.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eLauren Goode:\u003c/strong\u003e  In the past week alone, I\u0026#39;ve heard a venture capitalist and a CEO say in separate interviews, this quote about how \u0026#34;six out of 10 jobs, 60% of jobs that exist now didn\u0026#39;t exist back in 1940.\u0026#34; Things change, things shift, technology enables new kinds of jobs. Futurists, CEOs, venture capitalists, they love this because it creates this blank space for what we haven\u0026#39;t been able to imagine yet, in terms of what jobs will exist. Do I believe that there are some jobs that Will\u0026#39;s son who he\u0026#39;s vibe coding with right now could potentially have that we haven\u0026#39;t even thought of yet?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eMichael Calore:\u003c/strong\u003e  Is everyone in Silicon Valley thinking about AI agents in the same way?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eWill Knight:\u003c/strong\u003e  I don\u0026#39;t think they are. I think there\u0026#39;s a lot of enthusiasm, but there\u0026#39;s also a ton of different definitions. Recently, I spoke to Sonya Huang, a partner at Sequoia who tracks AI. She was saying that most agents startups, most of the companies offering agents, are really just rebranding existing AI tools as agents.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eLauren Goode:\u003c/strong\u003e  Yeah. To Will\u0026#39;s earlier point, there\u0026#39;s no real clear definition of what an AI agent is right now or what it\u0026#39;s supposed to be. There\u0026#39;s really a wide spectrum, so companies can move the needle and define it however they want to. Or say they\u0026#39;re offering it in a certain way. I think that we\u0026#39;re going to also see I think something maybe of a cottage industry pop up around the spaces in between agentic AI. Let\u0026#39;s say for example, there is an authentication bottleneck that happens when you dispatch an agent to complete a bunch of different tasks online through a bunch of different apps. There\u0026#39;s needs to be some kind of connection there between those apps, and it needs to be safe and secure. I think you\u0026#39;re going to see solutions emerge for that. I think you\u0026#39;re going to see some version of last mile shipping, but for coding. Because right now, there\u0026#39;s a lot of vibe coding happening and people talking about vibe coding, and \u0026#34;look what this bot can do for me.\u0026#34; But not all of that code is actually shippable. You have to be able to debug it and you have to be able to ship it. It has to run, it has to work. I think you\u0026#39;ll start to see more and more startups and companies trying to offer solutions to all these little gaps and bottlenecks that exist between the AI agents. Then our jobs will be taken fully. Good times.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eMichael Calore:\u003c/strong\u003e  Will, for people like us who are consumers of this technology ... We\u0026#39;re not vibe coding like Will.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eLauren Goode:\u003c/strong\u003e  Not yet.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eMichael Calore:\u003c/strong\u003e  By and large, we\u0026#39;re encountering agentic AI in some form in our daily lives. As it becomes more prevalent, how can we assess its potential and its risks in a levelheaded way?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eWill Knight:\u003c/strong\u003e  First of all, I think you should all be vibe coding. I\u0026#39;m making all manner of garbage. When I\u0026#39;m vibe coding, I very consciously do it on a machine where I don\u0026#39;t mind if it deletes a bunch of files, because it is really unpredictable and will sometimes do that. I don\u0026#39;t really know how you do that for something that you\u0026#39;re going to let loose on your shopping. Do you have a budget that you just let the agent spend? I think that\u0026#39;s a great question. The risk is obviously all going to be put entirely on us, I should imagine.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eMichael Calore:\u003c/strong\u003e  Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eLauren Goode:\u003c/strong\u003e  Yeah. But I think as these agents get better and better at doing tasks for us, we have at least a few responsibilities. One is we do have to disrupt ourselves and our habits and learn how to use new tools because they\u0026#39;re going to take over our lives. Two, we have to figure out where we fit in as humans and retain some of that human agency and still participate, stay in the loop, still participate in our own lives, not just let tech take it over. Three, we have to think really hard about the ethics and the privacy and security of what these AI agents are doing as they take over people\u0026#39;s lives. The promise from all the optimists is that this is going to close the equality gap. Once again, it\u0026#39;s going to be great for everybody. We know almost for certain this is not going to be great for everybody.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eMichael Calore:\u003c/strong\u003e  Yeah. That\u0026#39;s why I\u0026#39;m the opposite of the optimists at this point. I think that great caution and great skepticism are things that are given here. We need to make sure that when we adopt these technologies, we do so in a way that is very, very thoughtful and cautious. This is something that feels familiar. Probably the most recent example is the phone, the smartphone. Something that causes friction in relationships, it\u0026#39;s something that you can pay attention to and you can ignore humans. You can use it to interact with other humans, you can use it to not interact with other humans. This force that has really eroded a small part of our humanity over the 15 or 20 years that this has been part of our lives. I can see that happening with AI agents as the things that we used to rely on people to do and the things that used to force us to interact with each other go away. I have the same experience whenever I ride in a Waymo instead of riding in an Uber or taking a taxi. The fact that now there\u0026#39;s no human in the equation, there\u0026#39;s no person to interact with. By doing that over and over again, I am slowly eroding my own sense of what it means to be a human being. I know it sounds really esoteric, but you can chart it over time and you\u0026#39;ll probably find that you\u0026#39;re feeling the same way in your own life. I would encourage people to make that decision about how they want to use AI agents. If they don\u0026#39;t feel like this is something that belongs in their lives, that they should vote with their dollars.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eWill Knight:\u003c/strong\u003e  Maybe we also need a renewed open source movement so we\u0026#39;re not just using agents that belong and funnel data to these giant companies.

I found it just fascinating and really revealing about what\u0026#39;s missing with AI when it comes to agency, and the importance of understanding human social interaction, human culture. When it comes to the big picture of intelligence in AGI, which everybody talks about, but they don\u0026#39;t really talk about that so much.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong class='font-bold'\u003eMichael Calore:\u003c/strong\u003e  Nice.

They do a fantastic job. There\u0026#39;s a lot going on in US cities right now, in particular Los Angeles, and also in San Francisco. There are ICE raids happening around the country and people are taking to the streets to protest them. Mission Local has been doing a great job covering what\u0026#39;s been going on in San Francisco so far. I recommend that you support them and support your local news if you can.

It is by the Norwegian writer Karl Ove Knausgaard who, Lauren, I\u0026#39;m sure you\u0026#39;re sick of me talking about. But it\u0026#39;s a fantastic essay. It\u0026#39;s called “The Reenchanted World.” It is Karl Ove reckoning with technology. He tells you about the first time he encountered a computer, which was 40 years ago. Then he just has not paid attention to computers at all and it starts to bother him. There\u0026#39;s a great quote near the top. \u0026#34;To keep somewhat informed about the political situation in the world is a duty, something one has no right to turn away from. Shouldn\u0026#39;t something similar apply to technology, given the immensity of it influence?\u0026#34; I love that quote, because it really gets to the center of what we\u0026#39;re talking about today. In order to engage with the world, you need to understand how these systems work. He goes to a Greek island to visit the writer James Bridle, because their book  \u003cem class='italic'\u003eWays of Being\u003c/em\u003e  is a really good introduction to intelligence and artificial intelligence and natural intelligence. They talk a lot about artificial intelligence and how its developed and how the various ways of computing intelligence have shown up in our lives.

It doesn’t hurt to click on the manufacturer’s name in Amazon (it should be a link) to see what else they’re selling, and you can make sure they have a real website and are sold in US stores by Googling the manufacturer’s name or plugging the product name into a tool like \u003ca href='https://www.google.com/shopping' class='link'\u003eGoogle Shopping\u003c/a\u003e.

Sellers will also often list different colors, refurbished (sometimes called Renewed), international, or other variations of a phone as a separate product. This kind of thing happens in all sorts of categories on Amazon. It’s often just the result of the messy way Amazon lets sellers make products in its database, but third-party sellers may find a way to make a duplicate-like product that’s different in some small way to get better visibility for their listing.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003ch2 class='text-xl font-semibold'\u003eA Few Final Tips\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere are a few other quick tips to help you avoid outright scams.

The 8 II’s mount screws are placed rather low, meaning the TV sat higher than I wanted, which is something to note if your mount is already in place.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe TV is subtly stylish, with familiar plastic checkers at the back panel, and paper-thin bezels out front. There’s some recency bias here, but I couldn’t help noticing how much milkier the panel looks compared to the LG G5’s black void, which I kept noticing throughout my evaluation. On the bright (or rather dark) side, the TV’s reflection handling is among the best I’ve seen, diffusing nearly everything but direct lighting, without the full matte look of Samsung’s latest models.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSoftware setup is a relative cinch with Google TV’s plug-and-go layout, letting you adjust most parameters with your phone and G Suite credentials.

Sony’s implementation has improved with each iteration, and apart from Google’s overly zealous ads, I had virtually no complaints over weeks of smooth streaming and navigation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat includes zoomy channel surfing through 50-odd channels via  \u003ca href='https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-tv-antennas/' class='link'\u003emy HD antenna\u003c/a\u003e  with the Bravia 8 II’s compact remote.

All-wheel drive is standard, with combined output from its two motors quoted at 224 kilowatts (300 horsepower) and 354 pound-feet (480 Newton meters) of torque.

Helpfully, though, it tells you if a charging site is “slow”, “fast,” or “very fast”. If a DC fast-charging site is set as a destination, the car automatically preconditions its battery, popping up a “Charge Assist” message.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStill, it’s not the fastest charging EV—the Genesis GV60 can charge at up to 300 kW in ideal conditions. The difference is only a few minutes, but Cadillac is behind in the specs war. I didn’t fast-charge at very low battery percentages, but the fastest rate I saw was 107 kW charging from 25 to 60 percent, far from the station’s rated 150-kW capacity. Yes, that included preconditioning before arrival. Cadillac claims drivers can add up to 79 miles of range in 10 minutes—again, under ideal circumstances of battery temperature, ambient temperature, and low state of charge.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class='AssetEmbedWrapper-eVDQiB byBkf asset-embed'\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cpicture class='ResponsiveImagePicture-cWuUZO dUOtEa AssetEmbedResponsiveAsset-cXBNxi lqMXz asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image'\u003e\u003cimg src='https://media.wired.com/photos/6848781a2af123826e9fca02/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/MY26_Cadillac_OptiqV_JS2_8778.jpg' alt='Image may contain Car Transportation and Vehicle'\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003eCourtesy of Cadillac\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003caside\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cpicture class='ResponsiveImagePicture-cWuUZO dUOtEa responsive-image'\u003e\u003cimg src='https://media.wired.com/photos/684878098c9b2dce7b96026e/1:1/w_150%2Cc_limit/Gear_Cadillac_MY26_Cadillac_OptiqV_CA1_0065.jpg' alt='Cadillac Optiq' class='mt-4 p-2 max-w-full h-auto rounded shadow-sm'\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eCadillac Optiq\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRating: 7/10\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003ca href='https://cna.st/p/YugL81LJJg6NKrcZi1LUBzP8rdPP1jCjmCTdH3BvW6TF5dj314Mp2BmUYGT6NURjcnaPd66NPJM8NYHF1jQ2qFy7vkXyYybYo4288puEdHrdCQoSWi5zn927DQcawpyGsPpyRSVnxCTnrc6AhXhb86odzXEDv6oJYp5sbjrPSiW4HoP4mb9K7BM83FFt43nAVVgozdJaXkYYMMmkHB8VaWv7fBKF7NMqeuvfSsFPqD5x' class='link'\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan\u003e$52,895\u003c/span\u003e at Cadillac\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eAll products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors.
